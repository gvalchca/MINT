abstract = {We present a general computational approach to simulate RNA folding kinetics that can be used to extract population kinetics, folding rates and the formation of particular substructures that might be intermediates in the folding process. Simulating RNA folding kinetics can provide unique insight into RNA whose functions are dictated by folding kinetics and not always by nucleotide sequence or the structure of the lowest free-energy state. The method first builds an approximate map (or model) of the folding energy landscape from which the population kinetics are analyzed by solving the master equation on the map. We present results obtained using an analysis technique, map-based Monte Carlo simulation, which stochastically extracts folding pathways from the map. Our method compares favorably with other computational methods that begin with a comprehensive free-energy landscape, illustrating that the smaller, approximate map captures the major features of the complete energy landscape. As a result, our method scales to larger RNAs. For example, here we validate kinetics of RNA of more than 200 nucleotides. Our method accurately computes the kinetics-based functional rates of wild-type and mutant ColE1 RNAII and MS2 phage RNAs showing excellent agreement with experiment.},

abstract = {Base-stacking interactions in canonical and crystal B-DNA and in Z-DNA steps are studied using the ab initio quantum-chemical method with inclusion of electron correlation. The stacking energies in canonical B-DNA base-pair steps vary from -9.5 kcal/mol (GG) to -13.2 kcal/mol (GC). The many-body nonadditivity term, although rather small in absolute value, influences the sequence dependence of stacking energy. The base-stacking energies calculated for CGC and a hypothetical TAT sequence in Z-configuration are similar to those in B-DNA. Comparison with older quantum-chemical studies shows that they do not provide even a qualitatively correct description of base stacking. We also evaluate the base-(deoxy)ribose stacking geometry that occurs in Z-DNA and in nucleotides linked by 2',5'-phosphodiester bonds. Although the molecular orbital analysis does not rule out the charge-transfer n-pi* interaction of the sugar 04' with the aromatic base, the base-sugar contact is stabilized by dispersion energy similar to that of stacked bases. The stabilization amounts to almost 4 kcal/mol and is thus comparable to that afforded by normal base-base stacking. This enhancement of the total stacking interaction could contribute to the propensity of short d(CG)n sequences to adopt the Z-conformation.},

abstract = {The 30S ribosomal subunit has two primary functions in protein synthesis. It discriminates against aminoacyl transfer RNAs that do not match the codon of messenger RNA, thereby ensuring accuracy in translation of the genetic message in a process called decoding. Also, it works with the 50S subunit to move the tRNAs and associated mRNA by precisely one codon, in a process called translocation. Here we describe the functional implications of the high-resolution 30S crystal structure presented in the accompanying paper, and infer details of the interactions between the 30S subunit and its tRNA and mRNA ligands. We also describe the crystal structure of the 30S subunit complexed with the antibiotics paromomycin, streptomycin and spectinomycin, which interfere with decoding and translocation. This work reveals the structural basis for the action of these antibiotics, and leads to a model for the role of the universally conserved 16S RNA residues A1492 and A1493 in the decoding process.},

Although the number of contacts between the RNA and the aminoglycosides varies between 20 and 31, up to eight direct hydrogen bonds between rings I and II of the neamine moiety are conserved in the observed complexes. The puckered sugar ring I is inserted into the A site helix by stacking against G1491 and forms a pseudo base pair with two H-bonds to the Watson-Crick sites of the universally conserved A1408. This central interaction helps to maintain A1492 and A1493 in a bulged-out conformation. All these structures of the minimal A site RNA complexed to various aminoglycosides display crystal packings with intermolecular contacts between the bulging A1492 and A1493 and the shallow/minor groove of Watson-Crick pairs in a neighbouring helix. In one crystal, one empty A site is observed. In two crystals, two aminoglycosides are bound to the same A site with one bound specifically and the other bound in various ways in the deep/major groove at the edge of the A sites.},

abstract = {We report a detailed all-atom simulation of the folding of the GCAA RNA tetraloop. The GCAA tetraloop motif is a very common and thermodynamically stable secondary structure in natural RNAs. We use our simulation methods to study the folding behavior of a 12-base GCAA tetraloop structure with a four-base helix adjacent to the tetraloop proper. We implement an all-atom Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of RNA structural dynamics using a Go potential. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of RNA and protein has realistic energetics and sterics, but is extremely expensive in terms of computational time. By coarsely treating non-covalent energetics, but retaining all-atom sterics and entropic effects, all-atom MC techniques are a useful method for the study of protein and now RNA. We observe a sharp folding transition for this structure, and in simulations at room temperature the state histogram shows three distinct minima: an unfolded state (U), a more narrow intermediated state (I), and a narrow folded state (F). The intermediate consists primarily of structures with the GCAA loop and some helix hydrogen bonds formed. Repeated kinetic folding simulations reveal that the number of helix base-pairs forms a simple 1D reaction coordinate for the I-->N transition.},

abstract = {The analysis of atomic-resolution RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures reveals that many internal and hairpin loops are modular, recurrent, and structured by conserved non-Watson-Crick base pairs. Structurally similar loops define RNA 3D motifs that are conserved in homologous RNA molecules, but can also occur at nonhomologous sites in diverse RNAs, and which often vary in sequence. To further our understanding of RNA motif structure and sequence variability and to provide a useful resource for structure modeling and prediction, we present a new method for automated classification of internal and hairpin loop RNA 3D motifs and a new online database called the RNA 3D Motif Atlas. To classify the motif instances, a representative set of internal and hairpin loops is automatically extracted from a nonredundant list of RNA-containing PDB files. Their structures are compared geometrically, all-against-all, using the FR3D program suite. The loops are clustered into motif groups, taking into account geometric similarity and structural annotations and making allowance for a variable number of bulged bases. The automated procedure that we have implemented identifies all hairpin and internal loop motifs previously described in the literature. All motif instances and motif groups are assigned unique and stable identifiers and are made available in the RNA 3D Motif Atlas (http://rna.bgsu.edu/motifs), which is automatically updated every four weeks. The RNA 3D Motif Atlas provides an interactive user interface for exploring motif diversity and tools for programmatic data access.},

Since the structural features of RNA are of major importance to their biological function, there is much interest in predicting RNA structure, either in free form or in interaction with various ligands, including proteins, metabolites and other molecules. In recent years, an increasing number of researchers have developed novel RNA algorithms for predicting RNA secondary and tertiary structures. In this review, we describe current experimental and computational advances and discuss recent ideas that are transforming the traditional view of RNA folding. To evaluate the performance of the most recent RNA 3D folding algorithms, we provide a comparative study in order to test the performance of available 3D structure prediction algorithms for an RNA data set of 43 structures of various lengths and motifs. We find that the algorithms vary widely in terms of prediction quality across different RNA lengths and topologies; most predictions have very large root mean square deviations from the experimental structure. We conclude by outlining some suggestions for future RNA folding research.},

abstract = {Small-probe contact dot surface analysis, with all explicit hydrogen atoms added and their van der Waals contacts included, was used to choose between the two possible orientations for each of 1554 asparagine (Asn) and glutamine (Gln) side-chain amide groups in a dataset of 100 unrelated, high-quality protein crystal structures at 0.9 to 1.7 A resolution. For the movable-H groups, each connected, closed set of local H-bonds was optimized for both H-bonds and van der Waals overlaps. In addition to the Asn/Gln "flips", this process included rotation of OH, SH, NH3+, and methionine methyl H atoms, flip and protonation state of histidine rings, interaction with bound ligands, and a simple model of water interactions. However, except for switching N and O identity for amide flips (or N and C identity for His flips), no non-H atoms were shifted. Even in these very high-quality structures, about 20 \% of the Asn/Gln side-chains required a 180 degrees flip to optimize H-bonding and/or to avoid NH2 clashes with neighboring atoms (incorporating a conservative score penalty which, for marginal cases, favors the assignment in the original coordinate file). The programs Reduce, Probe, and Mage provide not only a suggested amide orientation, but also a numerical score comparison, a categorization of the marginal cases, and a direct visualization of all relevant interactions in both orientations. Visual examination allowed confirmation of the raw score assignment for about 40 \% of those Asn/Gln flips placed within the "marginal" penalty range by the automated algorithm, while uncovering only a small number of cases whose automated assignment was incorrect because of special circumstances not yet handled by the algorithm. It seems that the H-bond and the atomic-clash criteria independently look at the same structural realities: when both criteria gave a clear answer they agreed every time. But consideration of van der Waals clashes settled many additional cases for which H-bonding was either absent or approximately equivalent for the two main alternatives. With this extra information, 86 \% of all side-chain amide groups could be oriented quite unambiguously. In the absence of further experimental data, it would probably be inappropriate to assign many more than this. Some of the remaining 14 \% are ambiguous because of coordinate error or inadequacy of the theoretical model, but the great majority of ambiguous cases probably occur as a dynamic mix of both flip states in the actual protein molecule. The software and the 100 coordinate files with all H atoms added and optimized and with amide flips corrected are publicly available.},

Contemporary functional analysis of RNA molecules, such as ribozymes or riboswitches, covers various issues, among which tertiary structure modeling becomes more and more important. A growing number of tools to model and predict RNA structure calls for an evaluation of these tools and the quality of outcomes their produce. Thus, the development of reliable methods designed to meet this need is relevant in the context of RNA tertiary structure analysis and can highly influence the quality and usefulness of RNA tertiary structure prediction in the nearest future. Here, we present RNAlyzer-a computational method for comparison of RNA 3D models with the reference structure and for discrimination between the correct and incorrect models. Our approach is based on the idea of local neighborhood, defined as a set of atoms included in the sphere centered around a user-defined atom. A unique feature of the RNAlyzer is the simultaneous visualization of the model-reference structure distance at different levels of detail, from the individual residues to the entire molecules.},

While RNAML, an XML-based representation, has been proposed as an exchange format for a select subset of information, it lacks domain-specific semantics that are essential for answering questions that require expert knowledge. Here, we describe an RNA knowledge base (RKB) for structure-based knowledge using RDF/OWL Semantic Web technologies. RKB extends a number of ontologies and contains basic terminology for nucleic acid composition along with context/model-specific structural features such as sugar conformations, base pairings and base stackings. RKB (available at http://semanticscience.org/projects/rkb) is populated with PDB entries and MC-Annotate structural annotation. We show queries to the RKB using description logic reasoning, thus opening the door to question answering over independently-published RNA knowledge using Semantic Web technologies.},

abstract = {The L1 stalk is a prominent mobile element of the large ribosomal subunit. We explore the structure and dynamics of its non-canonical rRNA elements, which include two kink-turns, an internal loop, and a tetraloop. We use bioinformatics to identify the L1 stalk RNA conservation patterns and carry out over 11.5 $\mu$s of MD simulations for a set of systems ranging from isolated RNA building blocks up to complexes of L1 stalk rRNA with the L1 protein and tRNA fragment. We show that the L1 stalk tetraloop has an unusual GNNA or UNNG conservation pattern deviating from major GNRA and YNMG RNA tetraloop families. We suggest that this deviation is related to a highly conserved tertiary contact within the L1 stalk. The available X-ray structures contain only UCCG tetraloops which in addition differ in orientation (anti vs syn) of the guanine. Our analysis suggests that the anti orientation might be a mis-refinement, although even the anti interaction would be compatible with the sequence pattern and observed tertiary interaction. Alternatively, the anti conformation may be a real substate whose population could be pH-dependent, since the guanine syn orientation requires protonation of cytosine in the tertiary contact. In absence of structural data, we use molecular modeling to explore the GCCA tetraloop that is dominant in bacteria and suggest that the GCCA tetraloop is structurally similar to the YNMG tetraloop. Kink-turn Kt-77 is unusual due to its 11-nucleotide bulge. The simulations indicate that the long bulge is a stalk-specific eight-nucleotide insertion into consensual kink-turn only subtly modifying its structural dynamics. We discuss a possible evolutionary role of helix H78 and a mechanism of L1 stalk interaction with tRNA. We also assess the simulation methodology. The simulations provide a good description of the studied systems with the latest bsc0$\chi$OL3 force field showing improved performance. Still, even bsc0$\chi$OL3 is unable to fully stabilize an essential sugar-edge H-bond between the bulge and non-canonical stem of the kink-turn. Inclusion of Mg(2+) ions may deteriorate the simulations. On the other hand, monovalent ions can in simulations readily occupy experimental Mg(2+) binding sites.},

abstract = {Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) is a DNA mimic with promising properties for the development of antisense agents. Antisense PNAs targeted to Escherichia coli genes can specifically inhibit gene expression, and attachment of PNA to the cell-permeabilizing peptide KFFKFFKFFK dramatically improves antisense potency. The improved potency observed earlier was suggested to be due to better cell uptake; however, the uptake kinetics of standard or modified PNAs into bacteria had not been investigated. Here we monitored outer and inner membrane permeabilization by using chemical probes that normally are excluded from cells but can gain access at points where membrane integrity is disturbed. Membrane permeabilization was much more rapid in the presence of peptide-PNA conjugates relative to the free components used alone or in combination. Indeed, peptide-PNAs permeabilized E. coli nearly as quickly as antimicrobial peptides. Furthermore, as expected for outer membrane-active compounds, added MgCl(2) reduced cell-permeabilization. Concurrent monitoring of outer and inner membrane permeabilization indicated that passage across the outer membrane is rate-limiting for uptake. The enhanced cell-permeation properties of peptide-PNAs can explain their potent antisense activity, and the results indicate an unanticipated synergy between the peptide and PNA components.},

@article{Zhang2010,
abstract = {Cell-free synthetic (enzymatic) pathway biotransformation (SyPaB) is the assembly of a number of purified enzymes (usually more than 10) and coenzymes for the production of desired products through complicated biochemical reaction networks that a single enzyme cannot do. Cell-free SyPaB, as compared to microbial fermentation, has several distinctive advantages, such as high product yield, great engineering flexibility, high product titer, and fast reaction rate. Biocommodities (e.g., ethanol, hydrogen, and butanol) are low-value products where costs of feedstock carbohydrates often account for approximately 30-70\% of the prices of the products. Therefore, yield of biocommodities is the most important cost factor, and the lowest yields of profitable biofuels are estimated to be ca. 70\% of the theoretical yields of sugar-to-biofuels based on sugar prices of ca. US\$ 0.18 per kg. The opinion that SyPaB is too costly for producing low-value biocommodities are mainly attributed to the lack of stable standardized building blocks (e.g., enzymes or their complexes), costly labile coenzymes, and replenishment of enzymes and coenzymes. In this perspective, I propose design principles for SyPaB, present several SyPaB examples for generating hydrogen, alcohols, and electricity, and analyze the advantages and limitations of SyPaB. The economical analyses clearly suggest that developments in stable enzymes or their complexes as standardized parts, efficient coenzyme recycling, and use of low-cost and more stable biomimetic coenzyme analogs, would result in much lower production costs than do microbial fermentations because the stabilized enzymes have more than 3 orders of magnitude higher weight-based total turn-over numbers than microbial biocatalysts, although extra costs for enzyme purification and stabilization are spent.},

abstract = {Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) targeted to the functional domains of 23S rRNA can inhibit translation and cell growth. However, effective inhibition of translation and cell growth using 16S rRNA-targeted PNA has still not been achieved. Here, we report that PNA targeted to the functional site of 16S rRNA could inhibit both gene expression in vitro and bacterial growth in pure culture with sequence specificity. We used 10-mer PNAs conjugated with a cell-penetrating peptide, which targeted the mRNA binding site at the 3' end of 16S rRNA. Using 0.6 microM of the peptide-PNAs, cell-free ss-galactosidase production decreased by 50\%, whereas peptide-PNAs with one or two mismatches to the target sequence showed much weaker inhibition effects. To determine the growth inhibition and bactericidal effects of the peptide-PNA conjugate, we performed OD measurement and viable cell counting. We observed dose- and sequence-dependent inhibition of cell growth and bactericidal effects. These growth inhibitory effects are observed both in the Gram-negative bacterium of Escherichia coli and the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Corynebacterium efficiens, although inhibitory concentrations were different for each bacterial species. These results present possibilities for 16S rRNA sequence-based specific bacterial growth inhibition using a peptide-PNA conjugate.},

This model allows us to unify all base pairing energetic contributions in an effective scoring function to tackle the problem of RNA folding. We show how pipelining two computer algorithms based on nucleotide cyclic motifs, MC-Fold and MC-Sym, reproduces a series of experimentally determined RNA three-dimensional structures from the sequence. This demonstrates how crucial the consideration of all base-pairing interactions is in filling the gap between sequence and structure. We use the pipeline to define rules of precursor microRNA folding in double helices, despite the presence of a number of presumed mismatches and bulges, and to propose a new model of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 -1 frame-shifting element.},

abstract = {MolProbity is a structure-validation web service that provides broad-spectrum solidly based evaluation of model quality at both the global and local levels for both proteins and nucleic acids. It relies heavily on the power and sensitivity provided by optimized hydrogen placement and all-atom contact analysis, complemented by updated versions of covalent-geometry and torsion-angle criteria. Some of the local corrections can be performed automatically in MolProbity and all of the diagnostics are presented in chart and graphical forms that help guide manual rebuilding. X-ray crystallography provides a wealth of biologically important molecular data in the form of atomic three-dimensional structures of proteins, nucleic acids and increasingly large complexes in multiple forms and states. Advances in automation, in everything from crystallization to data collection to phasing to model building to refinement, have made solving a structure using crystallography easier than ever. However, despite these improvements, local errors that can affect biological interpretation are widespread at low resolution and even high-resolution structures nearly all contain at least a few local errors such as Ramachandran outliers, flipped branched protein side chains and incorrect sugar puckers. It is critical both for the crystallographer and for the end user that there are easy and reliable methods to diagnose and correct these sorts of errors in structures. MolProbity is the authors' contribution to helping solve this problem and this article reviews its general capabilities, reports on recent enhancements and usage, and presents evidence that the resulting improvements are now beneficially affecting the global database.},

@article{Putman2000,
abstract = {One of the mechanisms that bacteria utilize to evade the toxic effects of antibiotics is the active extrusion of structurally unrelated drugs from the cell. Both intrinsic and acquired multidrug transporters play an important role in antibiotic resistance of several pathogens, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio cholerae. Detailed knowledge of the molecular basis of drug recognition and transport by multidrug transport systems is required for the development of new antibiotics that are not extruded or of inhibitors which block the multidrug transporter and allow traditional antibiotics to be effective. This review gives an extensive overview of the currently known multidrug transporters in bacteria. Based on energetics and structural characteristics, the bacterial multidrug transporters can be classified into five distinct families. Functional reconstitution in liposomes of purified multidrug transport proteins from four families revealed that these proteins are capable of mediating the export of structurally unrelated drugs independent of accessory proteins or cytoplasmic components. On the basis of (i) mutations that affect the activity or the substrate specificity of multidrug transporters and (ii) the three-dimensional structure of the drug-binding domain of the regulatory protein BmrR, the substrate-binding site for cationic drugs is predicted to consist of a hydrophobic pocket with a buried negatively charged residue that interacts electrostatically with the positively charged substrate. The aromatic and hydrophobic amino acid residues which form the drug-binding pocket impose restrictions on the shape and size of the substrates. Kinetic analysis of drug transport by multidrug transporters provided evidence that these proteins may contain multiple substrate-binding sites.},

@article{Gladki2013,
abstract = {One of the major issues in the fight against infectious diseases is the notable increase in multiple drug resistance in pathogenic species. For that reason, newly acquired high-throughput data on virulent microbial agents attract the attention of many researchers seeking potential new drug targets. Many approaches have been used to evaluate proteins from infectious pathogens, including, but not limited to, similarity analysis, reverse docking, statistical 3D structure analysis, machine learning, topological properties of interaction networks or a combination of the aforementioned methods. From a biological perspective, most essential proteins (knockout lethal for bacteria) or highly conserved proteins (broad spectrum activity) are potential drug targets. Ribosomal proteins comprise such an example. Many of them are well-known drug targets in bacteria. It is intuitive that we should learn from nature how to design good drugs. Firstly, known antibiotics are mainly originating from natural products of microorganisms targeting other microorganisms. Secondly, paleontological data suggests that antibiotics have been used by microorganisms for million years. Thus, we have hypothesized that good drug targets are evolutionary constrained and are subject of evolutionary selection. This means that mutations in such proteins are deleterious and removed by selection, which makes them less susceptible to random development of resistance. Analysis of the speed of evolution seems to be good approach to test this hypothesis.},

The 12 gene clusters producing the structural RNA components of the ribosome are critically important for cellular viability, yet fall into this unassembled region of the Human Genome Project. To determine the extent of human variation in ribosomal RNA gene content (rDNA) and patterns of rDNA cluster inheritance, we have determined the physical lengths of the rDNA clusters in peripheral blood white cells of healthy human volunteers. The cluster lengths exhibit striking variability between and within human individuals, ranging from 50 kb to >6 Mb, manifest essentially complete heterozygosity, and provide each person with their own unique rDNA electrophoretic karyotype. Analysis of these rDNA fingerprints in multigenerational human families demonstrates that the rDNA clusters are subject to meiotic rearrangement at a frequency >10\% per cluster, per meiosis. With this high intrinsic recombinational instability, the rDNA clusters may serve as a unique paradigm of potential human genomic plasticity.},

DNA sequencing showed that positions 1219-1230 of the 23S rRNA gene are deleted in the mutant.

abstract = {We have determined the secondary structure of the human 28S rRNA molecule based on comparative analysis of available eukaryotic cytoplasmic and prokaryotic large-rRNA gene sequences. Examination of large-rRNA sequences of both distantly and closely related species has enabled us to derive a structure that accounts both for highly conserved sequence tracts and for previously unanalyzed variable-sequence tracts that account for the evolutionary differences in size among the large rRNAs. Human 28S rRNA is composed of two different types of sequence tracts: conserved and variable. They differ in composition, degree of conservation, and evolution. The conserved regions demonstrate a striking constancy of size and sequence. We have confirmed that the conserved regions of large-rRNA molecules are capable of forming structures that are superimposable on one another. The variable regions contain the sequences responsible for the 83\% increase in size of the human large-rRNA molecule over that of Escherichia coli. Their locations in the gene are maintained during evolution. They are G + C rich and largely nonhomologous, contain simple repetitive sequences, appear to evolve by frequent recombinational events, and are capable of forming large, stable hairpins. The secondary-structure model presented here is in close agreement with existing prokaryotic 23S rRNA secondary-structure models. The introduction of this model helps resolve differences between previously proposed prokaryotic and eukaryotic large-rRNA secondary-structure models.},

abstract = {The set of "expansion segments" of any eukaryotic 26S/28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene is responsible for the bulk of the difference in length between the prokaryotic 23S rRNA gene and the eukaryotic 26S/28S rRNA gene. The expansion segments are also responsible for interspecific fluctuations in length during eukaryotic evolution. They show a consistent bias in base composition in any species; for example, they are AT rich in Drosophila melanogaster and GC rich in vertebrate species. Dot-matrix comparisons of sets of expansion segments reveal high similarities between members of a set within any 28S rRNA gene of a species, in contrast to the little or spurious similarity that exists between sets of expansion segments from distantly related species. Similarities among members of a set of expansion segments within any 28S rRNA gene cannot be accounted for by their base-compositional bias alone. In contrast, no significant similarity exists within a set of "core" segments (regions between expansion segments) of any 28S rRNA gene, although core segments are conserved between species. The set of expansion segments of a 26S/28S gene is coevolving as a unit in each species, at the same time as the family of 28S rRNA genes, as a whole, is undergoing continual homogenization, making all sets of expansion segments from all ribosomal DNA (rDNA) arrays in a species similar in sequence. Analysis of DNA simplicity of 26S/28S rRNA genes shows a direct correlation between significantly high relative simplicity factors (RSFs) and sequence similarity among a set of expansion segments. A similar correlation exists between RSF values, overall rDNA lengths, and the lengths of individual expansion segments. Such correlations suggest that most length fluctuations reflect the gain and loss of simple sequence motifs by slippage-like mechanisms. We discuss the molecular coevolution of expansion segments, which takes place against a background of slippage-like and unequal crossing-over mechanisms of turnover that are responsible for the accumulation of interspecific differences in rDNA sequences.},

The expansion segments account for most of the size difference between prokaryotic (archaeal and eubacterial) and eukaryotic rRNAs and they exhibit a sequence variation which is unique among rRNAs. We have investigated the sequence variation of one of the expansion segments, V8, by sequencing a total of 111 V8 segments from 9 different human cell lines and tissues and have found 35 different variants. The variation occur mainly at two 'hot spots' which are separated by 170 nucleotides in the primary sequence but are neighbours in the secondary structure. The sequence of V8 segments varies both within and between human cell lines and tissues. The implications for the evolution of the eukaryotic 28S rRNA are discussed together with possible functions of the expansion segments. We also present a secondary structure model for the V8 segment based on comparative sequence analysis and chemical and enzymatic foot printing.},

abstract = {We have investigated the extent of sequence variation in human ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and the expression of specific rRNA gene variants in different tissues of an individual. Focusing on the fifth variable region (V5; nt 2065-2244) of the 28S rRNA gene, we find that sequence differences between rRNA genes of a single individual are characterized by differences in number of repeats of simple sequences at four specific sites. These data support and extend previous findings which show similar V5 sequence variation in rRNA genes from a group of individuals. We performed experiments to determine if there is differential gene expression within the rRNA multigene family. From the analysis of data of six variant V5 probes protected from RNase digestion by rRNAs isolated from different tissues of the individual, we conclude that each variant rRNA is present in a similar proportion in these tissues, whereas the actual contributions of variants differ, their relative proportion is maintained from tissue to tissue in an individual. We favor the explanation of a gene dosage effect over that of a regulated gene effect to account for this pattern of rRNA gene expression. In addition, computer generated secondary structure models of each V5 clone structure predict the same three helix structure with the regions of sequence variation contained in one stem-loop structure.},

Homogenization is not perfect, however, so that it becomes possible to study its efficiency within genes, within arrays, and between arrays by measuring and comparing DNA sequence variation. Previous studies with randomly cloned genomic DNA fragments showed that different parts of the gene evolve at different rates but did not allow comparison of rDNA sequences derived from specific chromosomes. We have now cloned and sequenced rDNA fragments from specific acrocentric chromosomes to (1) study homogenization along the rDNA and (2) compare homogenization within chromosomes and between homologous and nonhomologous chromosomes. Our results show high homogeneity among regulatory and coding regions of rDNA on all chromosomes, a surprising homogeneity among adjacent distal non-rDNA sequences, and the existence of one to three very divergent intergenic spacer classes within each array.},

However, some significant differences in functionally important regions and dramatic changes in the periphery due to expansion segments and additional ribosomal proteins are evident. As in the bacterial ribosome, bridges between the subunits are mainly formed by RNA contacts. Four new bridges are present at the periphery. The position of the P site tRNA coincides precisely with its prokaryotic counterpart, with mainly rRNA contributing to its molecular environment. This analysis presents an exhaustive inventory of an eukaryotic ribosome at the molecular level.},

abstract = {Functional large ribosomal subunits of Thermus aquaticus can be reconstituted from ribosomal proteins and either natural or in vitro transcribed 23 S and 5 S rRNA. Omission of 5 S rRNA during subunit reconstitution results in dramatic decrease of the peptidyl transferase activity of the assembled subunits. However, the presence of some ribosome-targeted antibiotics of the macrolide, ketolide or streptogramin B groups during 50 S subunit reconstitution can partly restore the activity of ribosomal subunits assembled without 5 S rRNA. Among tested antibiotics, macrolide RU69874 was the most active: activity of the subunits assembled in the absence of 5 S rRNA was increased more than 30-fold if antibiotic was present during reconstitution procedure. Activity of the subunits assembled with 5 S rRNA was also slightly stimulated by RU69874, but to a much lesser extent, approximately 1.5-fold. Activity of the native T. aquaticus 50 S subunits incubated in the reconstitution conditions in the presence of RU69874 was, in contrast, slightly decreased. The presence of antibiotics was essential during the last incubation step of the in vitro assembly, indicating that drugs affect one of the last assembly steps. The 5 S rRNA was previously shown to form contacts with segments of domains II and V of 23 S rRNA. All the antibiotics which can functionally compensate for the lack of 5 S rRNA during subunit reconstitution interact simultaneously with the central loop in domain V (which is known to be a component of peptidyl transferase center) and a loop of the helix 35 in domain II of 23 S rRNA. It is proposed that simultaneous interaction of 5 S rRNA or of antibiotics with the two domains of 23 S rRNA is essential for the successful assembly of ribosomal peptidyl transferase center. Consequently, one of the functions of 5 S rRNA in the ribosome can be that of assisting the assembly of ribosomal peptidyl transferase by correctly positioning functionally important segments of domains II and V of 23 S rRNA.},

(1987) Nature, 327, 389-394]. When the mutations were introduced into the expression vector pKK3535, only two of them (913A----G and 915A----G) permitted recovery of viable transformants. Ribosomes were isolated from the transformed bacteria and were assayed for their response to streptomycin in poly(U)- and MS2 RNA-directed assays. They were resistant to the stimulation of misreading and to the inhibition of protein synthesis by streptomycin, and this correlated with a decreased binding of the drug. These results therefore demonstrate that, in line with the footprinting studies of Moazed and Noller, mutations in the 915 region alter the interaction between the ribosome and streptomycin.},

abstract = {We describe two structures of the intact bacterial ribosome from Escherichia coli determined to a resolution of 3.5 angstroms by x-ray crystallography. These structures provide a detailed view of the interface between the small and large ribosomal subunits and the conformation of the peptidyl transferase center in the context of the intact ribosome. Differences between the two ribosomes reveal a high degree of flexibility between the head and the rest of the small subunit. Swiveling of the head of the small subunit observed in the present structures, coupled to the ratchet-like motion of the two subunits observed previously, suggests a mechanism for the final movements of messenger RNA (mRNA) and transfer RNAs (tRNAs) during translocation.},

abstract = {Two factors are mainly responsible for the stability of the DNA double helix: base pairing between complementary strands and stacking between adjacent bases. By studying DNA molecules with solitary nicks and gaps we measure temperature and salt dependence of the stacking free energy of the DNA double helix. For the first time, DNA stacking parameters are obtained directly (without extrapolation) for temperatures from below room temperature to close to melting temperature. We also obtain DNA stacking parameters for different salt concentrations ranging from 15 to 100 mM Na+. From stacking parameters of individual contacts, we calculate base-stacking contribution to the stability of A*T- and G*C-containing DNA polymers. We find that temperature and salt dependences of the stacking term fully determine the temperature and the salt dependence of DNA stability parameters. For all temperatures and salt concentrations employed in present study, base-stacking is the main stabilizing factor in the DNA double helix. A*T pairing is always destabilizing and G*C pairing contributes almost no stabilization. Base-stacking interaction dominates not only in the duplex overall stability but also significantly contributes into the dependence of the duplex stability on its sequence.},

In addition to secondary and tertiary structure motifs, there are functional motifs specific for certain biological roles and binding motifs that serve to complex metals or other ligands.

abstract = {New methods are described for finding recurrent three-dimensional (3D) motifs in RNA atomic-resolution structures. Recurrent RNA 3D motifs are sets of RNA nucleotides with similar spatial arrangements. They can be local or composite. Local motifs comprise nucleotides that occur in the same hairpin or internal loop. Composite motifs comprise nucleotides belonging to three or more different RNA strand segments or molecules. We use a base-centered approach to construct efficient, yet exhaustive search procedures using geometric, symbolic, or mixed representations of RNA structure that we implement in a suite of MATLAB programs, "Find RNA 3D" (FR3D). The first modules of FR3D preprocess structure files to classify base-pair and -stacking interactions. Each base is represented geometrically by the position of its glycosidic nitrogen in 3D space and by the rotation matrix that describes its orientation with respect to a common frame. Base-pairing and base-stacking interactions are calculated from the base geometries and are represented symbolically according to the Leontis/Westhof basepairing classification, extended to include base-stacking. These data are stored and used to organize motif searches. For geometric searches, the user supplies the 3D structure of a query motif which FR3D uses to find and score geometrically similar candidate motifs, without regard to the sequential position of their nucleotides in the RNA chain or the identity of their bases. To score and rank candidate motifs, FR3D calculates a geometric discrepancy by rigidly rotating candidates to align optimally with the query motif and then comparing the relative orientations of the corresponding bases in the query and candidate motifs. Given the growing size of the RNA structure database, it is impossible to explicitly compute the discrepancy for all conceivable candidate motifs, even for motifs with less than ten nucleotides. The screening algorithm that we describe finds all candidate motifs whose geometric discrepancy with respect to the query motif falls below a user-specified cutoff discrepancy. This technique can be applied to RMSD searches. Candidate motifs identified geometrically may be further screened symbolically to identify those that contain particular basepair types or base-stacking arrangements or that conform to sequence continuity or nucleotide identity constraints. Purely symbolic searches for motifs containing user-defined sequence, continuity and interaction constraints have also been implemented. We demonstrate that FR3D finds all occurrences, both local and composite and with nucleotide substitutions, of sarcin/ricin and kink-turn motifs in the 23S and 5S ribosomal RNA 3D structures of the H. marismortui 50S ribosomal subunit and assigns the lowest discrepancy scores to bona fide examples of these motifs. The search algorithms have been optimized for speed to allow users to search the non-redundant RNA 3D structure database on a personal computer in a matter of minutes.},

abstract = {The various motifs of RNA molecules are closely related to their structural and functional properties. To better understand the nature and distributions of such structural motifs (i.e., paired and unpaired bases in stems, junctions, hairpin loops, bulges, and internal loops) and uncover characteristic features, we analyze the large 16S and 23S ribosomal RNAs of Escherichia coli. We find that the paired and unpaired bases in structural motifs have characteristic distribution shapes and ranges; for example, the frequency distribution of paired bases in stems declines linearly with the number of bases, whereas that for unpaired bases in junctions has a pronounced peak. Significantly, our survey reveals that the ratio of total (over the entire molecule) unpaired to paired bases (0.75) and the fraction of bases in stems (0.6), junctions (0.16), hairpin loops (0.12), and bulges/internal loops (0.12) are shared by 16S and 23S ribosomal RNAs, suggesting that natural RNAs may maintain certain proportions of bases in various motifs to ensure structural integrity. These findings may help in the design of novel RNAs and in the search (via constraints) for RNA-coding motifs in genomes, problems of intense current focus.},

Previous studies have focused on the characterization and discovery of 3D motifs in RNA secondary and tertiary structures. However, statistical analyses of the distribution of 3D motifs along the RNA appear to be lacking. Herein, we present a novel strategy for evaluating the distribution of 3D motifs along the RNA chain and those motifs whose distributions are significantly non-random are identified. By applying it to the X-ray structure of the large ribosomal subunit from Haloarcula marismortui, helical motifs were found to cluster together along the chain and in the 3D structure, whereas the known tetraloops tend to be sequentially and spatially dispersed. That the distribution of key structural motifs such as tetraloops differ significantly from a random one suggests that our method could also be used to detect novel 3D motifs of any size in sufficiently long/large RNA structures. The motif distribution type can help in the prediction and design of 3D structures of large RNA molecules.},

Many of these RNA structures are assembled from a collection of RNA structural motifs. These basic building blocks are used repeatedly, and in various combinations, to form different RNA types and define their unique structural and functional properties. Identification of recurring RNA structural motifs will therefore enhance our understanding of RNA structure and help associate elements of RNA structure with functional and regulatory elements. Our goal was to develop a computer program that can describe an RNA structural element of any complexity and then search any nucleotide sequence database, including the complete prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, for these structural elements. Here we describe in detail a new computational motif search algorithm, RNAMotif, and demonstrate its utility with some motif search examples. RNAMotif differs from other motif search tools in two important aspects: first, the structure definition language is more flexible and can specify any type of base-base interaction; second, RNAMotif provides a user controlled scoring section that can be used to add capabilities that patterns alone cannot provide.},

abstract = {RNA molecules exhibit complex structures in which a large fraction of the bases engage in non-Watson-Crick base pairing, forming motifs that mediate long-range RNA-RNA interactions and create binding sites for proteins and small molecule ligands. The rapidly growing number of three-dimensional RNA structures at atomic resolution requires that databases contain the annotation of such base pairs. An unambiguous and descriptive nomenclature was proposed recently in which RNA base pairs were classified by the base edges participating in the interaction (Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen/CH or sugar edge) and the orientation of the glycosidic bonds relative to the hydrogen bonds (cis or trans). Twelve basic geometric families were identified and all 12 have been observed in crystal structures. For each base pairing family, we present here the 4 x 4 'isostericity matrices' summarizing the geometric relationships between the 16 pairwise combinations of the four standard bases, A, C, G and U. Whenever available, a representative example of each observed base pair from X-ray crystal structures (3.0 A resolution or better) is provided or, otherwise, theoretically plausible models. This format makes apparent the recurrent geometric patterns that are observed and helps identify isosteric pairs that co-vary or interchange in sequences of homologous molecules while maintaining conserved three-dimensional motifs.},

Two concepts are key to understanding RNA structure: hierarchical organization of global structure and isostericity of local interactions. Global structure changes extremely slowly, as it relies on conserved long-range tertiary interactions. Tertiary RNA-RNA and quaternary RNA-protein interactions are mediated by RNA motifs, defined as recurrent and ordered arrays of non-Watson-Crick base-pairs. A single RNA motif comprises a family of sequences, all of which can fold into the same three-dimensional structure and can mediate the same interaction(s). The chemistry and geometry of base pairing constrain the evolution of motifs in such a way that random mutations that occur within motifs are accepted or rejected insofar as they can mediate a similar ordered array of interactions. The steps involved in the analysis and annotation of RNA motifs in 3D structures are: (a) decomposition of each motif into non-Watson-Crick base-pairs; (b) geometric classification of each basepair; (c) identification of isosteric substitutions for each basepair by comparison to isostericity matrices; (d) alignment of homologous sequences using the isostericity matrices to identify corresponding positions in the crystal structure; (e) acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis that the motif is conserved.},

We show that Isostericity Matrices for non-Watson-Crick base pairs provide important tools for deriving the sequence signatures of recurrent motifs, for scoring and refining sequence alignments, and for determining whether motifs are conserved throughout evolution. The systematic use of Isostericity Matrices identifies the positions of the insertion or deletion of one or more nucleotides relative to the structurally characterized examples of motifs and, most importantly, specifies whether these changes result in new motifs. Thus, comparative analysis coupled with Isostericity Matrices allows one to produce and refine structural sequence alignments. The analysis, based on both sequence and structure, permits therefore the evaluation of the conservation of motifs across phylogeny and the derivation of rules of equivalence between structural motifs. The conservations observed in Isostericity Matrices form a predictive basis for identifying motifs in sequences.},

abstract = {Nucleotide bases are recognized by amino acid residues in a variety of DNA/RNA binding and nucleotide binding proteins. In this study, a total of 446 crystal structures of nucleotide-protein complexes are analyzed manually and pseudo pairs together with single and bifurcated hydrogen bonds observed between bases and amino acids are classified and annotated. Only 5 of the 20 usual amino acid residues, Asn, Gln, Asp, Glu and Arg, are able to orient in a coplanar fashion in order to form pseudo pairs with nucleotide bases through two hydrogen bonds. The peptide backbone can also form pseudo pairs with nucleotide bases and presents a strong bias for binding to the adenine base. The Watson-Crick side of the nucleotide bases is the major interaction edge participating in such pseudo pairs. Pseudo pairs between the Watson-Crick edge of guanine and Asp are frequently observed. The Hoogsteen edge of the purine bases is a good discriminatory element in recognition of nucleotide bases by protein side chains through the pseudo pairing: the Hoogsteen edge of adenine is recognized by various amino acids while the Hoogsteen edge of guanine is only recognized by Arg. The sugar edge is rarely recognized by either the side-chain or peptide backbone of amino acid residues.},

Advanced query involves filters sensitive to: modified residue contents, experimental method used and limits of conformational parameters. The output list of query-matching RNA fragments gives access to their coordinates in the PDB-format files, ready for direct download and visualization, conformational parameters and information about base pairs.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The function of a protein depends not only on its structure, but also on its dynamics. This is at the basis of a large body of experimental and theoretical work on protein dynamics. Further insight into the dynamics-function relationship can be gained by studying the evolutionary divergence of protein motions. To investigate this, we need appropriate comparative dynamics methods. The most used dynamical similarity score is the correlation between the Root Mean Square Fluctuations (RMSF) of aligned residues. Despite its usefulness, RMSF is in general less evolutionarily conserved than the native structure. A fundamental issue is whether RMSF is not as conserved as structure because dynamics is less conserved or because RMSF is not the best property to use to study its conservation. RESULTS: We performed a systematic assessment of several scores that quantify the (dis)similarity between protein fluctuation patterns. We show that the best scores perform as well as or better than structural dissimilarity, as assessed by their consistency with the SCOP classification. We conclude that to uncover the full extent of the evolutionary conservation of protein fluctuation patterns, it is important to measure the directions of fluctuations and their correlations between sites.

abstract = {Thermodynamics of the thermal dissociation transitions of 10 bp PNA/DNA duplexes and their corresponding DNA/DNA duplexes in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) were determined from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. The PNA/DNA transition temperatures ranged from 329 to 343 K and the calorimetric transition enthalpies ranged from 209 +/- 6 to 283 +/- 37 kJ mol(-1). The corresponding DNA/DNA transition temperatures were 7-20 K lower and the transition enthalpies ranged from 72 +/- 29 to 236 +/- 24 kJ mol(-1). Agreement between the DSC and UV monitored melting (UVM) determined transition enthalpies validated analyzing the UVM transitions in terms of a two-state transition model. The transitions exhibited reversibility and were analyzed in terms of an AB = A + B two-state transition model which yielded van't Hoff enthalpies in agreement with the transition enthalpies. Extrapolation of the transition enthalpies and free energy changes to ambient temperatures yielded more negative values than those determined directly from isothermal titration calorimetry measurements on formation of the duplexes. This discrepancy was attributed to thermodynamic differences in the single-strand structures at ambient and at the transition temperatures, as indicated by UVM measurements on single DNA and PNA strands.},

abstract = {For further characterization of the hybridization properties of peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), the thermodynamics of hybridization of mixed sequence PNA-DNA duplexes have been studied. We have characterized the binding of PNA to DNA in terms of binding affinity (perfectly matched duplexes) and sequence specificity of binding (singly mismatched duplexes) using mainly absorption hypochromicity melting curves and isothermal titration calorimetry. For perfectly sequence-matched duplexes of varying lengths (6-20 bp), the average free energy of binding (DeltaG degrees ) was determined to be -6.5+/-0.3 kJ mol(-1) bp(-1), corresponding to a microscopic binding constant of about 14 M(-1) bp(-1). A variety of single mismatches were introduced in 9- and 12-mer PNA-DNA duplexes. Melting temperatures (T(m)) of 9- and 12-mer PNA-DNA duplexes with a single mismatch dropped typically 15-20 degrees C relative to that of the perfectly matched sequence with a corresponding free energy penalty of about 15 kJ mol(-1) bp(-1). The average cost of a single mismatch is therefore estimated to be on the order of or larger than the gain of two matched base pairs, resulting in an apparent binding constant of only 0.02 M(-1) per mismatch. The impact of a mismatch was found to be dependent on the neighboring base pairs. To a first approximation, increasing the stability of the surrounding region, i.e., the distribution of A.T and G.C base pairs, decreases the effect of the introduced mismatch.},

abstract = {Oligonucleotide-based therapies have been under investigation for many years, and different antisense oligomers are being tested in clinical trials on patients with cancer and other diseases. Since telomerase reactivation has been defined as one of the six hallmarks of cancer because of the enzyme's ability to provide tumor cells with unlimited proliferative potential, antisense-based approaches, aimed to inhibit the core enzyme components, could represent innovative anticancer therapies. Overall, available information indicates antisense-based strategies as powerful tools to inhibit telomerase and interfere with tumor cell proliferative potential. Specifically, cancer cell growth arrest was observed in several tumor models as a consequence of telomere shortening in the presence of prolonged telomerase inhibition. However, in other studies, antisense-based treatments caused rapid loss of tumor cell viability and induced apoptosis independently of telomere attrition. The results would suggest that telomerase inhibition affects tumor cell growth by mechanisms that are dependent as well as independent of the enzyme telomere elongating activity. However, the role of telomerase in tumorigenesis and tumor progression, beyond the classical mechanism of telomere lengthening, needs to be further investigated to provide a better rationale for the design and development of antitelomerase-based therapies in clinical oncology.},

Meanwhile, it became clear that RNAs are versatile molecules that do not only play key roles in many important biological processes like splicing, editing, protein export and others, but can also--like enzymes--act catalytically. Two important aspects of RNA function--antisense-RNA control and RNA interference (RNAi)--are emphasized in this review. Antisense-RNA control functions in all three kingdoms of life--although the majority of examples are known from bacteria. In contrast, RNAi, gene silencing triggered by double-stranded RNA, the oldest and most ubiquitous antiviral system, is exclusively found in eukaryotes. Our current knowledge about occurrence, biological roles and mechanisms of action of antisense RNAs as well as the recent findings about involved genes/enzymes and the putative mechanism of RNAi are summarized. An interesting intersection between both regulatory mechanisms is briefly discussed.},

A low-resolution anharmonic network model that allows for the evolution of tertiary structure and long-scale sampling was developed and parameterized. Most importantly, we find that functionally important movements of L7/L12 and L1 lateral stalks are anticorrelated. Other principal directions of motions include widening of the tRNA cleft and the rotation of the small subunit which occurs as one block and is in phase with the movement of L1 stalk. The effect of the dynamical correlation pattern on the elongation process is discussed. Small fluctuations of the 3' tRNA termini and anticodon nucleotides show tight alignment of substrates for the reaction. Our model provides an efficient and reliable way to study the dynamics of large biomolecular systems composed of both proteins and nucleic acids.},

abstract = {Combining structural data for the ribosome from x-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy with dynamic models based on elastic network normal mode analysis, an atomically detailed picture of functionally important structural rearrangements that occur during translocation is elucidated. The dynamic model provides a near-atomic description of the ratchet-like rearrangement of the 70S ribosome seen in cryo-electron microscopy, and permits the identification of bridging interactions that either facilitate the conformational switching or maintain structural integrity of the 50S/30S interface. Motions of the tRNAs residing in the A and P sites also suggest the early stages of tRNA translocation as a result of this ratchet-like movement. Displacement of the L1 stalk, alternately closing and opening the intersubunit space near the E site, is observed in the dynamic model, in line with growing experimental evidence for the role of this structural component in facilitating the exiting of tRNA. Finally, a hinge-like transition in the 30S ribosomal subunit, similar to that observed in crystal structures of this complex, is also manifest as a dynamic mode of the ribosome. The coincidence of these dynamic transitions with the individual normal modes of the ribosome and the good correspondence between these motions and those observed in experiment suggest an underlying principle of nature to exploit the shape of molecular assemblies such as the ribosome to provide robustness to functionally important motions.},

abstract = {The motions of large systems such as the ribosome are not fully accessible with conventional molecular simulations. A coarse-grained, less-than-atomic-detail model such as the anisotropic network model (ANM) is a convenient informative tool to study the cooperative motions of the ribosome. The motions of the small 30S subunit, the larger 50S subunit, and the entire 70S assembly of the two subunits have been analyzed using ANM. The lowest frequency collective modes predicted by ANM show that the 50S subunit and 30S subunit are strongly anti-correlated in the motion of the 70S assembly. A ratchet-like motion is observed that corresponds well to the experimentally reported ratchet motion. Other slow modes are also examined because of their potential links to the translocation steps in the ribosome. We identify several modes that may facilitate the E-tRNA exiting from the assembly. The A-site t-RNA and P-site t-RNA are found to be strongly coupled and positively correlated in these slow modes, suggesting that the translocations of these two t-RNAs occur simultaneously, while the motions of the E-site t-RNA are less correlated, and thus less likely to occur simultaneously. Overall the t-RNAs exhibit relatively large deformations. Animations of these slow modes of motion can be viewed at.},

abstract = {The ribosome is a complex macromolecular machine responsible for protein synthesis in the cell. It consists of two subunits, each of which contains both RNA and protein components. Ribosome assembly is subject to intricate regulatory control and is aided by a multitude of assembly factors in vivo, but can also be carried out in vitro. The details of the assembly process remain unknown even in the face of atomic structures of the entire ribosome and after more than three decades of research. Some of the earliest research on ribosome assembly produced the Nomura assembly map of the small subunit, revealing a hierarchy of protein binding dependencies for the 20 proteins involved and suggesting the possibility of a single intermediate. Recent work using a combination of RNA footprinting and pulse-chase quantitative mass spectrometry paints a picture of small subunit assembly as a dynamic and varied landscape, with sequential and hierarchical RNA folding and protein binding events finally converging on complete subunits. Proteins generally lock tightly into place in a 5' to 3' direction along the ribosomal RNA, stabilizing transient RNA conformations, while RNA folding and the early stages of protein binding are initiated from multiple locations along the length of the RNA.},

abstract = {The structures of ribosomal proteins and their interactions with RNA have been examined in the refined crystal structure of the Haloarcula marismortui large ribosomal subunit. The protein structures fall into six groups based on their topology. The 50S subunit proteins function primarily to stabilize inter-domain interactions that are necessary to maintain the subunit's structural integrity. An extraordinary variety of protein-RNA interactions is observed. Electrostatic interactions between numerous arginine and lysine residues, particularly those in tail extensions, and the phosphate groups of the RNA backbone mediate many protein-RNA contacts. Base recognition occurs via both the minor groove and widened major groove of RNA helices, as well as through hydrophobic binding pockets that capture bulged nucleotides and through insertion of amino acid residues into hydrophobic crevices in the RNA. Primary binding sites on contiguous RNA are identified for 20 of the 50S ribosomal proteins, which along with few large protein-protein interfaces, suggest the order of assembly for some proteins and that the protein extensions fold cooperatively with RNA. The structure supports the hypothesis of co-transcriptional assembly, centered around L24 in domain I. Finally, comparing the structures and locations of the 50S ribosomal proteins from H.marismortui and D.radiodurans revealed striking examples of molecular mimicry. These comparisons illustrate that identical RNA structures can be stabilized by unrelated proteins.},

The ribosome, which carries out protein synthesis, is one such machine, and the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome is the preeminent model system for biophysical analysis of large RNA-protein complexes. Our understanding of 30S assembly is incomplete, owing to the challenges of monitoring the association of many components simultaneously. Here we have developed a method involving pulse-chase monitored by quantitative mass spectrometry (PC/QMS) to follow the assembly of the 20 ribosomal proteins with 16S ribosomal RNA during formation of the functional particle. These data represent a detailed and quantitative kinetic characterization of the assembly of a large multicomponent macromolecular complex. By measuring the protein binding rates at a range of temperatures, we find that local transformations throughout the assembling subunit have similar but distinct activation energies. Thus, the prevailing view of 30S assembly as a pathway proceeding through a global rate-limiting conformational change must give way to one in which the assembly of the complex traverses a landscape dotted with various local conformational transitions.},

abstract = {Many RNAs do not directly code proteins but are nonetheless indispensable to cellular function. These strands fold into intricate three-dimensional shapes that are essential structures in protein synthesis, splicing, and many other processes of gene regulation and expression. A variety of biophysical and biochemical methods are now showing, in real time, how ribosomal subunits and other ribonucleoprotein complexes assemble from their molecular components. Footprinting methods are particularly useful for studying the folding of long RNAs: they provide quantitative information about the conformational state of each residue and require little material. Data from footprinting complement the global information available from small-angle X-ray scattering or cryo-electron microscopy, as well as the dynamic information derived from single-molecule F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and NMR methods. In this Account, I discuss how we have used hydroxyl radical footprinting and other experimental methods to study pathways of RNA folding and 30S ribosome assembly. Hydroxyl radical footprinting probes the solvent accessibility of the RNA backbone at each residue in as little as 10 ms, providing detailed views of RNA folding pathways in real time. In conjunction with other methods such as solution scattering and single-molecule FRET, time-resolved footprinting of ribozymes showed that stable domains of RNA tertiary structure fold in less than 1 s. However, the free energy landscapes for RNA folding are rugged, and individual molecules kinetically partition into folding pathways that lead through metastable intermediates, stalling the folding or assembly process. Time-resolved footprinting was used to follow the formation of tertiary structure and protein interactions in the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) during the assembly of 30S ribosomes. As previously observed in much simpler ribozymes, assembly occurs in stages, with individual molecules taking different routes to the final complex. Interactions occur concurrently in all domains of the 16S rRNA, and multistage protection of binding sites of individual proteins suggests that initial encounter complexes between the rRNA and ribosomal proteins are remodeled during assembly. Equilibrium footprinting experiments showed that one primary binding protein was sufficient to stabilize the tertiary structure of the entire 16S 5'-domain. The rich detail available from the footprinting data showed that the secondary assembly protein S16 suppresses non-native structures in the 16S 5'-domain. In doing so, S16 enables a conformational switch distant from its own binding site, which may play a role in establishing interactions with other domains of the 30S subunit. Together, the footprinting results show how protein-induced changes in RNA structure are communicated over long distances, ensuring cooperative assembly of even very large RNA-protein complexes such as the ribosome.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: An important objective in developing new drugs is the achievement of high specificity to maximize curing effect and minimize side-effects, and high specificity is an integral part of the antisense approach. The antisense techniques have been extensively developed from the application of simple long, regular antisense RNA (asRNA) molecules to highly modified versions conferring resistance to nucleases, stability of hybrid formation and other beneficial characteristics, though still preserving the specificity of the original nucleic acids. These new and improved second- and third-generation antisense molecules have shown promising results. The first antisense drug has been approved and more are in clinical trials. However, these antisense drugs are mainly designed for the treatment of different human cancers and other human diseases. Applying antisense gene silencing and exploiting RNA interference (RNAi) are highly developed approaches in many eukaryotic systems. But in bacteria RNAi is absent, and gene silencing by antisense compounds is not nearly as well developed, despite its great potential and the intriguing possibility of applying antisense molecules in the fight against multiresistant bacteria. Recent breakthrough and current status on the development of antisense gene silencing in bacteria including especially phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (PS-ODNs), peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) will be presented in this review.},

abstract = {The ribosomal peptidyl transferase center (PTC) resides in the large ribosomal subunit and catalyzes the two principal chemical reactions of protein synthesis: peptide bond formation and peptide release. The catalytic mechanisms employed and their inhibition by antibiotics have been in the focus of molecular and structural biologists for decades. With the elucidation of atomic structures of the large ribosomal subunit at the dawn of the new millennium, these questions gained a new level of molecular significance. The crystallographic structures compellingly confirmed that peptidyl transferase is an RNA enzyme. This places the ribosome on the list of naturally occurring ribozymes that outlived the transition from the pre-biotic RNA World to contemporary biology. Biochemical, genetic and structural evidence highlight the role of the ribosome as an entropic catalyst that accelerates peptide bond formation primarily by substrate positioning. At the same time, peptide release should more strongly depend on chemical catalysis likely involving an rRNA group of the PTC. The PTC is characterized by the most pronounced accumulation of universally conserved rRNA nucleotides in the entire ribosome. Thus, it came as a surprise that recent findings revealed an unexpected high level of variation in the mode of antibiotic binding to the PTC of ribosomes from different organisms.},

No prestructuring effect on the tRNA anticodon stem-loop from the two modifications could be observed, but we identified two mechanisms that may contribute to the expanded decoding capability by the modifications: The further reach of the cmo(5)U34 allows an alternative outer conformation to be formed for the noncognate base pairs, and the modification results in increased contacts between tRNA, mRNA, and the ribosome.},

abstract = {With the emergence of atomic-resolution crystal structures of bacterial ribosomal subunits, major advances in eliciting structure-function relationships of the translation process are underway. Nevertheless, the detailed mechanism of peptide bond synthesis that occurs on the large ribosomal subunit remains unknown. Separate x-ray structures of aminoacyl-tRNA and peptidyl-tRNA analogues bound to the ribosomal A- and P-sites, however, allow for structural modeling of the active complex in catalysis. Here, we combine available structural data to construct such a model of the peptidyl transfer reaction center with bound substrates. Molecular dynamics and free energy perturbation simulations then are used in combination with an empirical valence bond description of the reaction energy surface to examine possible catalytic mechanisms. Already, simulations of the reactant and tetrahedral intermediate states reveal a stable, preorganized H-bond network poised for catalysis. The most favorable mechanism is found not to involve any general acid-base catalysis by ribosomal groups but an intra-reactant proton shuttling via the P-site adenine O2' oxygen, which follows the attack of the A-site alpha-amino group on the P-site ester. The calculated rate enhancement for this mechanism is approximately 10(5), and the catalytic effect is found to be entirely of entropic origin, in accordance with recent experimental data, and is associated with the reduction of solvent reorganization energy rather than with substrate alignment or proximity. This mechanism also explains the inability of 2'-deoxyadenine P-site substrates to promote peptidyl transfer. The observed H-bond network suggests an important structural role of several universally conserved rRNA residues.},

abstract = {The ribosome is a highly dynamic machine responsible for protein synthesis within the cell. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography structures of ribosomal particles, alone and in complex with diverse ligands (protein factors, RNAs and small molecules), have revealed the dynamic nature of the ribosome and provided much needed insight into translation and its regulation. In the past years, there has been exponential growth in the deposition of cryo-EM maps into the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) as well as atomic structures into the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Unfortunately, the deposited ribosomal particles usually have distinct orientations with respect to one another, which complicate the comparison of the available structures. To simplify this, we have developed a Database of Aligned Ribosomal Complexes, the DARC site (http://darcsite.genzentrum.lmu.de/darc/), which houses the available cryo-EM maps and atomic coordinates of ribosomal particles from the EMDB and PDB aligned within a common coordinate system. An easy-to-use, searchable interface allows users to access and download >130 cryo-EM maps and >300 atomic models in the format of brix and pdb files, respectively. The aligned coordinate system substantially simplifies direct visualization of conformational changes in the ribosome, such as subunit rotation and head-swiveling, as well as direct comparison of bound ligands, such as antibiotics or translation factors.},

Despite the chemical diversity of the known antibiotics that affect functions of the large ribosomal subunit, these drugs act on only a few sites corresponding to some of the known functional centers. We have used a genetic approach for identifying structurally and functionally critical sites in the ribosome that can be used as new antibiotic targets. By using randomly mutagenized rRNA genes, we mapped rRNA sites where nucleotide alterations impair the ribosome function or assembly and lead to a deleterious phenotype. A total of 77 single-point deleterious mutations were mapped in 23 S rRNA and ranked according to the severity of their deleterious phenotypes. Many of the mutations mapped to familiar functional sites that are targeted by known antibiotics. However, a number of mutations were located in previously unexplored regions. The distribution of the mutations in the spatial structure of the ribosome showed a strong bias, with the strongly deleterious mutations being mainly localized at the interface of the large subunit and the mild ones on the solvent side. Five sites where deleterious mutations tend to cluster within discrete rRNA elements were identified as potential new antibiotic targets. One of the sites, the conserved segment of helix 38, was studied in more detail. Although the ability of the mutant 50 S subunits to associate with 30 S subunits was impaired, the lethal effect of mutations in this rRNA element was unrelated to its function as an intersubunit bridge. Instead, mutations in this region had a profound deleterious effect on the ribosome assembly.},

The sites of action of known drugs are limited in number, are composed primarily of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and coincide with functionally critical centers of the ribosome. Nucleotide alterations within such sites are often deleterious. To identify functional sites and potential sites of antibiotic action in the ribosome, we prepared a random mutant library of rRNA genes and selected dominant mutations in 16S rRNA that interfere with cell growth. Fifty-three 16S rRNA positions were identified whose mutation inhibits protein synthesis. Mutations were ranked according to the severity of the phenotype, and the detrimental effect of several mutations on translation was verified in a specialized ribosome system. Analysis of the polysome profiles of mutants suggests that the majority of the mutations directly interfered with ribosome function, whereas a smaller fraction of mutations affected assembly of the small ribosomal subunit. Twelve of the identified mutations mapped to sites targeted by known antibiotics, confirming that deleterious mutations can be used to identify antibiotic targets. About half of the mutations coincided with known functional sites in the ribosome, whereas the rest of the mutations affected ribosomal sites with less clear functional significance. Four clusters of deleterious mutations in otherwise unremarkable ribosomal sites were identified, suggesting their functional importance and potential as antibiotic targets.},

abstract = {The ribosome represents a major target for antibacterial drugs. Being a complex molecular machine, it offers many potential sites for functional interference. The high-resolution structures of ribosome in complex with various antibiotics provide a unique data set for understanding the universal features of drug-binding pockets on the ribosome. In this work, we have analyzed the structural and evolutionary properties of 65 antibiotic binding sites (ABSs) in the ribosome. We compared these sites to similar-size computed pockets extracted from the small and large ribosomal subunits. Based on this analysis, we defined properties of the known drug-binding sites, which constitute the signature of a 'druggable' site. The most noticeable properties of the ABSs are prevalence of non-paired bases, a strong bias in favor of unusual syn conformation of the RNA bases and an unusual sugar pucker. We propose that despite the different geometric and chemical properties of diverse antibiotics, their binding sites tend to have common attributes that possibly reflect the potency of the pocket for binding small molecules. Finally, we utilized the ensemble of properties to derive a druggability index, which can be used in conjunction with site functionality information to identify new drug-binding sites on the ribosome.},

abstract = {The harmonic mode analysis method was used to characterize the conformational deformability of regular Watson-Crick paired, mismatch- and bulge-containing RNA. Good agreement between atomic Debye-Waller factors derived from x-ray crystallography of a regular RNA oligonucleotide and calculated atomic fluctuations was obtained. Calculated helical coordinate fluctuations showed a small sequence dependence of up to approximately 30-50\%. A negative correlation between motions at a given base pair step and neighboring steps was found for most helical coordinates. Only very few calculated modes contribute significantly to global motions such as bending, twisting, and stretching of the RNA molecules. With respect to a local helical description of the RNA helix our calculations suggest that RNA bending is mostly due to a periodic change in the base pair step descriptors slide and roll. The presence of single guanine:uridine or guanine:adenine mismatches had little influence on the calculated RNA flexibility. In contrast, for tandem guanine:adenine base pairs the harmonic mode approach predicts a significantly reduced conformational flexibility in the case of a sheared arrangement and slightly enhanced flexibility for a face-to-face (imino proton) pairing relative to regular RNA. The presence of a single extra adenine bulge nucleotide stacked between flanking sequences resulted in an increased local atomic mobility around the bulge site (approximately 40\%) and a slightly enhanced global bending flexibility. For an adenine bulge nucleotide in a looped-out conformation a strongly enhanced bulge nucleotide mobility but no increased bending flexibility compared to regular RNA was found.},

In addition, the base-pair and backbone geometry from high-resolution crystal structures of the Dickerson-Drew dodecamer was used to re-evaluate the deoxyribose pseudorotation profile and the Lennard-Jones nonbonded energy terms. With a modified dielectric function that assumes a very steep distance-dependent form, a deoxyribose pseudorotation profile with reduced energy barriers between C2'- and C3'-endo minima, and a shift of the Lennard-Jones potential energy minimum to a distance approximately 0.4 A greater than the sum of the van der Waals' radii, the sequence-dependent conformational features of the Dickerson-Drew dodecamer in both the solid state and the aqueous liquid crystalline phase are well reproduced. The robust performance of the revised force field, in conjunction with its efficiency through implicit treatment of solvent and counterions, provides a valuable tool for elucidating conformations and structure-function relationships of DNA, including those of molecules modified by carcinogens and other ligands.},

abstract = {Guanine:adenine (G:A) mismatches and in particular tandem G:A (tG:A) mismatches are frequently observed in biological RNA molecules and can serve as sites for tertiary interaction, metal binding and protein recognition. Depending on the surrounding sequence tG:A mismatches can adopt different basepairing topologies. In the sequence context (5'-) GGAC (tandem G:A in bold) a face-to-face (imino or Watson-Crick-like) pairing is preferred whereas in the CGAG context, G and A adopt a sheared arrangement. Systematic conformational searches with a generalized Born continuum model and molecular dynamics simulations including explicit water molecules and ions have been used to generate face-to-face and sheared tG:A mismatches in both CGAG and GGAC sequence contexts. Conformations from both approaches were evaluated using the same force field and a Poisson-Boltzmann continuum solvent model. Although the substate analysis predicted the sheared arrangement to be energetically preferred in both sequence contexts, a significantly greater preference of the sheared form was found for the CGAG context. In agreement with the experimental observation, the analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories indicated a preference of the sheared form in the case of the CGAG-context and a favorization of the face-to-face form in the case of the GGAC context. The computational studies allowed to identify energetic contributions that stabilize or destabilize the face-to-face and sheared tandem mismatch topologies. The calculated nonpolar solvation and Lennard-Jones packing interaction were found to stabilize the sheared topology independent of the sequence context. Electrostatic contributions are predicted to make the most significant contribution to the sequence context dependence on the structural preference of tG:A mismatches.},

abstract = {A computational analysis of d(GGGGTTTTGGGG)(2) guanine quadruplexes containing either lateral or diagonal four-thymidine loops was carried out using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit solvent, locally enhanced sampling (LES) simulations, systematic conformational search, and free energy molecular-mechanics, Poisson Boltzmann, surface area (MM-PBSA) calculations with explicit inclusion of structural monovalent cations. The study provides, within the approximations of the applied all-atom additive force field, a qualitatively complete analysis of the available loop conformational space. The results are independent of the starting structures. Major conformational transitions not seen in conventional MD simulations are observed when LES is applied. The favored LES structures consistently provide lower free energies (as estimated by molecular-mechanics, Poisson Boltzmann, surface area) than other structures. Unfortunately, the predicted optimal structure for the diagonal loop arrangement differs substantially from the atomic resolution experiments. This result is attributed to force field deficiencies, such as the potential misbalance between solute-cation and solvent-cation terms. The MD simulations are unable to maintain the stable coordination of the monovalent cations inside the diagonal loops as reported in a recent x-ray study. The optimal diagonal and lateral loop arrangements appear to be close in energy although a proper inclusion of the loop monovalent cations could stabilize the diagonal architecture.},

abstract = {Kink-turn (K-turn) motifs are asymmetric internal loops found at conserved positions in diverse RNAs, with sharp bends in phosphodiester backbones producing V-shaped structures. Explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for three K-turns from 23S rRNA, i.e., Kt-38 located at the base of the A-site finger, Kt-42 located at the base of the L7/L12 stalk, and Kt-58 located in domain III, and for the K-turn of human U4 snRNA. The simulations reveal hinge-like K-turn motions on the nanosecond timescale. The first conserved A-minor interaction between the K-turn stems is entirely stable in all simulations. The angle between the helical arms of Kt-38 and Kt-42 is regulated by local variations of the second A-minor (type I) interaction between the stems. Its variability ranges from closed geometries to open ones stabilized by insertion of long-residency waters between adenine and cytosine. The simulated A-minor geometries fully agree with x-ray data. Kt-58 and Kt-U4 exhibit similar elbow-like motions caused by conformational change of the adenosine from the nominally unpaired region. Despite the observed substantial dynamics of K-turns, key tertiary interactions are stable and no sign of unfolding is seen. We suggest that some K-turns are flexible elements mediating large-scale ribosomal motions during the protein synthesis cycle.},

abstract = {Molecular modeling and molecular dynamics have been employed to study the conformation and flexibility of a 15-nucleotide fragment of the plant 5S rRNA containing loop D and a single uridine bulge. Two different model built initial structures were used: one with the bulge localized inside the helical stem and another with the bulge pointing out from the helix. Several independent 700-ps-long trajectories in aqueous solution with Na(+) conterions were produced for each starting structure. The bulge nucleotide inside the helix stayed in two main conformations, both of which affected the geometry of the stem part opposite the bulge. When the bulge nucleotide was located outside the helix, we found high base mobility and local backbone flexibility. The dynamics of the hydrogen bond network and conformational changes from a direct to a water mediated hydrogen bond in the sheared G-A basepair in the tetraloop was described. Our results correlate with lead ion induced cleavage patterns in 5S rRNA. Sites resistant to nonspecific lead cleavage appeared in all our simulations as the most rigid fragments independent of the localization of the bulge nucleotide.},

abstract = {The helical hairpin is one of the most ubiquitous and elementary secondary structural motifs in nucleic acids, capable of serving functional roles and participating in long-range tertiary contacts. Yet the self-assembly of these structures has not been well-characterized at the atomic level. With this in mind, the dynamics of nucleic acid hairpin formation and disruption have been studied using a novel computational tool: large-scale, parallel, atomistic molecular dynamics simulation employing an inhomogeneous distributed computer consisting of more than 40,000 processors. Using multiple methodologies, over 500 micro s of atomistic simulation time has been collected for a large ensemble of hairpins (sequence 5'-GGGC[GCAA]GCCU-3'), allowing characterization of rare events not previously observable in simulation. From uncoupled ensemble dynamics simulations in unperturbed folding conditions, we report on 1), competing pathways between the folded and unfolded regions of the conformational space; 2), observed nonnative stacking and basepairing traps; and 3), a helix unwinding-rewinding mode that is differentiated from the unfolding and folding dynamics. A heterogeneous transition state ensemble is characterized structurally through calculations of conformer-specific folding probabilities and a multiplexed replica exchange stochastic dynamics algorithm is used to derive an approximate folding landscape. A comparison between the observed folding mechanism and that of a peptide beta-hairpin analog suggests that although native topology defines the character of the folding landscape, the statistical weighting of potential folding pathways is determined by the chemical nature of the polymer.},

Molecular dynamics simulations of nine tRNA anticodon stem-loops with different combinations of nonstandard bases were performed. The wild-type simulation exhibited a canonical anticodon stair-stepped conformation. The ms2t6 modification at position 37 is required for maintenance of this structure and reduces solvent accessibility of U36. Ms2t6A37 generally hydrogen bonds across the loop and may prevent U36 from rotating into solution.

abstract = {The modification of RNA nucleotide bases, a fundamental process in all cells, alters the chemical and physical properties of RNA molecules and broadly impacts the physiological properties of cells. tRNA molecules are by far the most diverse-modified RNA species within cells, containing as a group >80\% of the known 96 chemically unique nucleic acid modifications. The greatest varieties of modifications are located on residue 37 and play a role in ensuring fidelity and efficiency of protein synthesis. The enzyme dimethylallyl (Delta(2)-isopentenyl) diphosphate:tRNA transferase catalyzes the addition of a dimethylallyl group to the exocyclic amine nitrogen (N6) of A(37) in several tRNA species. Using a 17 residue oligoribonucleotide corresponding to the anticodon arm of Escherichia coli tRNA(Phe), we have investigated the structural and dynamic changes introduced by the dimethylallyl group. The unmodified RNA molecule adopts stem-loop conformation composed of seven base-pairs and a compact three nucleotide loop. This conformation is distinctly different from the U-turn motif that characterizes the anticodon arm in the X-ray crystal structure of the fully modified yeast tRNA(Phe). The adoption of the tri-nucleotide loop by the purine-rich unmodified tRNA(Phe) anticodon arm suggests that other anticodon sequences, especially those containing pyrimidine bases, also may favor a tri-loop conformation. Introduction of the dimethylallyl modification increases the mobility of nucleotides of the loop region but does not dramatically alter the RNA conformation. The dimethylallyl modification may enhance ribosome binding through multiple mechanisms including destabilization of the closed anticodon loop and stabilization of the codon-anticodon helix.},

In the rarer C2'-endo sugar puckers, orientations towards the O3' atom of the same sugar are strongly favoured. Surprisingly, in helical regions, the frequently suggested intra-strand O2'-H(n)...O4'(n+1) interaction is not found. This observation led to the detection of an axial C-H...O interaction between the C2'-H2'(n) group and the O4'(n+1) atom contributing to the stabilization of RNA helical regions. Subsequent analysis of crystallographic structures of both RNA and A-DNA helices fully supports this finding. Specific hydration patterns are also thought to play a significant role in the stabilization of RNA structures. In the shallow groove of RNA, known as a favourable RNA or protein-binding region, three well-defined hydration sites are located around the O2' atom. These hydration sites, occupied by water molecules exchanging with the bulk, constitute, after dehydration, anchor points for specific interactions between RNA and nucleic acids, proteins or drugs. Therefore, the fact that the 2'-hydroxyl group is not monopolised by axial stabilization, together with its water-like behaviour, facilitates complex formation involving RNA helical regions.},

Average structures display an A-DNA base geometry with the CHARMM force field and a base geometry that is intermediate between A- and B-DNA with the AMBER force field. The backbone assumes B form on both strands with the AMBER force field, while the CHARMM force field produces heterogeneous structures with the purine strand in A form and the pyrimidine strand in dynamical equilibrium between A and B conformations. The results compare well with experimental data for the cytosine/guanine part but fail to fully reproduce an overall B conformation in the thymine/adenine tract expected from crystallographic data, particularly with the CHARMM force field. Fluctuations between A and B conformations are observed on the nanosecond time scale in both simulations, particularly with the AMBER force field. Different dynamical behavior during the first 4 ns indicates that convergence times of several nanoseconds are necessary to fully establish a dynamical equilibrium in all structural quantities on the time scale of the simulations presented here.},

abstract = {Translation on the ribosome is controlled by external factors. During polypeptide lengthening, elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G consecutively interact with the bacterial ribosome. EF-Tu binds and delivers an aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A site and EF-G helps translocate the tRNAs between their binding sites after the peptide bond is formed. These processes occur at the expense of GTP. EF-Tu:tRNA and EF-G are of similar shape, share a common binding site, and undergo large conformational changes on interaction with the ribosome. To characterize the internal motion of these two elongation factors, we used 25 ns long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We observed enhanced mobility of EF-G domains III, IV, and V and of tRNA in the EF-Tu:tRNA complex. EF-Tu:GDP complex acquired a configuration different from that found in the crystal structure of EF-Tu with a GTP analogue, showing conformational changes in the switch I and II regions. The calculated electrostatic properties of elongation factors showed no global similarity even though matching electrostatic surface patches were found around the domain I that contacts the ribosome, and in the GDP/GTP binding region.},

abstract = {The ribosome is a large macromolecular machine, and correlated motion between residues is necessary for coordinating function across multiple protein and RNA chains. We ran two all-atom, explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations of the bacterial ribosome and calculated correlated motion between residue pairs by using mutual information. Because of the short timescales of our simulation (ns), we expect that dynamics are largely local fluctuations around the crystal structure. We hypothesize that residues that show coupled dynamics are functionally related, even on longer timescales. We validate our model by showing that crystallographic B-factors correlate well with the entropy calculated as part of our mutual information calculations. We reveal that A-site residues move relatively independently from P-site residues, effectively insulating A-site functions from P-site functions during translation.},

The late binding proteins in our assembly map were found not to bind to the naked 16S RNA. The 5' domain early kinetic class proteins, on average, carry the highest positive charge, get buried the most upon binding to 16S RNA, and show the most favorable binding. Some proteins (S10/S14, S6/S18, S13/S19) have more stabilizing interactions while binding as dimers. Our computed assembly map resembles that of E. coli; however, the central domain path is more similar to that of A. aeolicus, a hyperthermophilic bacteria.},

abstract = {Genistein, daidzein, glycitein and quercetin are flavonoids present in soybean and other vegetables in high amounts. These flavonoids can be metabolically converted to more active forms, which may react with guanine in the DNA to form complexes and can lead to DNA depurination. We assumed two ultimate carcinogen forms of each of these flavonoids, diol epoxide form and diketone form. Density functional theory (DFT) and Hartree-Fock (HF) methods were used to study the reaction thermodynamics between active forms of flavonoids and DNA guanine. Solvent reaction field method of Tomasi and co-workers and the Langevin dipoles method of Florian and Warshel were used to calculate the hydration free energies. Activation free energy for each reaction was estimated using the linear free energy relation. Our calculations show that diol epoxide forms of flavonoids are more reactive than the corresponding diketone forms and are hence more likely flavonoid ultimate carcinogens. Genistein, daidzein and glycitein show comparable reactivity while quercetin is less reactive toward DNA.},

abstract = {Decoding is the key step during protein synthesis that enables information transfer from RNA to protein, a process critical for the survival of all organisms. We have used large-scale (2.64 x 10(6) atoms) all-atom simulations of the entire ribosome to understand a critical step of decoding. Although the decoding problem has been studied for more than four decades, the rate-limiting step of cognate tRNA selection has only recently been identified. This step, known as accommodation, involves the movement inside the ribosome of the aminoacyl-tRNA from the partially bound "A/T" state to the fully bound "A/A" state. Here, we show that a corridor of 20 universally conserved ribosomal RNA bases interacts with the tRNA during the accommodation movement. Surprisingly, the tRNA is impeded by the A-loop (23S helix 92), instead of enjoying a smooth transition to the A/A state. In particular, universally conserved 23S ribosomal RNA bases U2492, C2556, and C2573 act as a 3D gate, causing the acceptor stem to pause before allowing entrance into the peptidyl transferase center. Our simulations demonstrate that the flexibility of the acceptor stem of the tRNA, in addition to flexibility of the anticodon arm, is essential for tRNA selection. This study serves as a template for simulating conformational changes in large (>10(6) atoms) biological and artificial molecular machines.},

abstract = {Accurate electrostatic descriptions of aqueous solvent are critical for simulation studies of bio-molecules, but the computational cost of explicit treatment of solvent is very high. A computationally more feasible alternative is a generalized Born implicit solvent description which models polar solvent as a dielectric continuum. Unfortunately, the attainable simulation speedup does not transfer to the massive parallel computers often employed for simulation of large structures. Longer cutoff distances, spatially heterogenous distribution of atoms and the necessary three-fold iteration over atom-pairs in each timestep combine to challenge efficient parallel performance of generalized Born implicit solvent algorithms. Here we report how NAMD, a parallel molecular dynamics program, meets the challenge through a unique parallelization strategy. NAMD now permits efficient simulation of large systems whose slow conformational motions benefit most from implicit solvent descriptions due to the inherent low viscosity. NAMD's implicit solvent performance is benchmarked and then illustrated in simulating the ratcheting Escherichia coli ribosome involving \~{}250,000 atoms.},

How G protein motor action is transmitted to RRF is unknown. Thermus thermophilus RRF is nonfunctional in Escherichia coli. It became functional upon introducing a plasmid expressing E. coli EF-G with surface changes in its tRNA-mimic domain or by replacing the E. coli EF-G tRNA-mimic domain by the Thermus domain. Thermus RRF could also be activated by introducing surface substitutions in its anticodon arm-mimic region. These gain-of-function phenotypes depend on the combination of heterologous EF-G and RRF alleles. These mutational studies suggest that EF-G motor action is transmitted to RRF by specific surface contacts between the domains that mimic the anticodon arm.},

abstract = {We present extensive explicit solvent molecular dynamics analysis of three RNA three-way junctions (3WJs) from the large ribosomal subunit: the 3WJ formed by Helices 90-92 (H90-H92) of 23S rRNA; the 3WJ formed by H42-H44 organizing the GTPase associated center (GAC) of 23S rRNA; and the 3WJ of 5S rRNA. H92 near the peptidyl transferase center binds the 3'-CCA end of amino-acylated tRNA. The GAC binds protein factors and stimulates GTP hydrolysis driving protein synthesis. The 5S rRNA binds the central protuberance and A-site finger (ASF) involved in bridges with the 30S subunit. The simulations reveal that all three 3WJs possess significant anisotropic hinge-like flexibility between their stacked stems and dynamics within the compact regions of their adjacent stems. The A-site 3WJ dynamics may facilitate accommodation of tRNA, while the 5S 3WJ flexibility appears to be essential for coordinated movements of ASF and 5S rRNA. The GAC 3WJ may support large-scale dynamics of the L7/L12-stalk region. The simulations reveal that H42-H44 rRNA segments are not fully relaxed and in the X-ray structures they are bent towards the large subunit. The bending may be related to L10 binding and is distributed between the 3WJ and the H42-H97 contact.},

@article{Burton2012,
abstract = {Assembly of the ribosome from its protein and RNA constituents has been studied extensively over the past 50 years, and experimental evidence suggests that prokaryotic ribosomal proteins undergo conformational changes during assembly. However, to date, no studies have attempted to elucidate these conformational changes. The present work utilizes computational methods to analyze protein dynamics and to investigate the linkage between dynamics and binding of these proteins during the assembly of the ribosome. Ribosomal proteins are known to be positively charged and we find the percentage of positive residues in r-proteins to be about twice that of the average protein: Lys+Arg is 18.7\% for E. coli and 21.2\% for T. thermophilus. Also, positive residues constitute a large proportion of RNA contacting residues: 39\% for E. coli and 46\% for T. thermophilus. This affirms the known importance of charge-charge interactions in the assembly of the ribosome. We studied the dynamics of three primary proteins from E. coli and T. thermophilus 30S subunits that bind early in the assembly (S15, S17, and S20) with atomic molecular dynamic simulations, followed by a study of all r-proteins using elastic network models. Molecular dynamics simulations show that solvent-exposed proteins (S15 and S17) tend to adopt more stable solution conformations than an RNA-embedded protein (S20). We also find protein residues that contact the 16S rRNA are generally more mobile in comparison with the other residues. This is because there is a larger proportion of contacting residues located in flexible loop regions. By the use of elastic network models, which are computationally more efficient, we show that this trend holds for most of the 30S r-proteins.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome with and without a nascent polypeptide inside the exit tunnel. Modeling of the polypeptide in the tunnel revealed two possible paths: one over Arg92 of L22 and one under (from the viewpoint of 50S on top of 30S). A strong interaction between L4 and Arg92 was observed without the polypeptide and when it passed over Arg92. However, when the polypeptide passed under, Arg92 repositioned to interact with Ade2059 of 23S rRNA. Using steered molecular dynamics the polypeptide could be pulled through the L4-L22 constriction when situated under Arg92, but did not move when over. These results suggest that the tunnel is closed by the Arg92-L4 interaction before elongation of the polypeptide and the tunnel leads the entering polypeptide from the peptidyl transferase center to the passage under Arg92, causing Arg92 to switch to an open position. It is possible, therefore, that Arg92 plays the role of a gate, opening and closing the tunnel at L4-L22. There is some disagreement over whether the tunnel is dynamic or rigid. At least within the timescale of our simulations conformational analysis showed that global motions mainly involve relative movement of the 50S and 30S subunits and seem not to affect the conformation of the tunnel.},

The results of our simulations suggest that at low ionic strength of the solution, both PNA molecules adsorb at the lipid-water interface. In the case where the PNA molecule has charged terminal groups, the main driving force of adsorption is the electrostatic attraction between the charged groups of PNA and the lipid heads. The main driving force of adsorption of the PNA molecule with neutral terminal groups is the hydrophobic interaction of the nonpolar groups. Our simulations suggest that the system free energy change associated with PNA adsorption at the lipid-water interface is on the order of several tens of kT per PNA molecule in both cases.},

abstract = {MD simulations of homomorphous single-stranded PNA, DNA, and RNA with the same base sequence have been performed in aqueous solvent. For each strand two separate simulations were performed starting from a (i) helical conformation and (ii) random coiled state. Comparisons of the simulations with the single-stranded helices (case i) show that the differences in the covalent nature of the backbones cause significant differences in the structural and dynamical properties of the strands. It is found that the PNA strand maintains its nice base-stacked initial helical structure throughout the 1.5-ns MD simulation at 300 K, while DNA/RNA show relatively larger fluctuations in the structures with a few local unstacking events during -ns MD simulation each. It seems that the weak physical coupling between the bases and the backbone in PNA causes a loss of correlation between the dynamics of the bases and the backbone compared to the DNA/RNA and helps maintain the base-stacked helical conformation. The global flexibility of a single-stranded PNA helix was also found to be lowest, while RNA appears to be the most flexible single-stranded helix. The sugar pucker of several nucleotides in single-stranded DNA and RNA was found to adopt both C2'-endo and C3'-endo conformations for significant times. This effect is more pronounced for single strands in completely coiled states. The simulations with single-stranded coils as the initial structure also indicate that a PNA can adopt a more compact globular structure, while DNA/RNA of the same size adopts a more extended coil structure. This allows even a short PNA in the coiled state to form a significantly stable nonsequentially base-stacked globular structure in solution. Due to the hydrophobic nature of the PNA backbone, it interacts with surrounding water rather weakly compared to DNA/RNA.},

abstract = {HMMER is a software suite for protein sequence similarity searches using probabilistic methods. Previously, HMMER has mainly been available only as a computationally intensive UNIX command-line tool, restricting its use. Recent advances in the software, HMMER3, have resulted in a 100-fold speed gain relative to previous versions. It is now feasible to make efficient profile hidden Markov model (profile HMM) searches via the web. A HMMER web server (http://hmmer.janelia.org) has been designed and implemented such that most protein database searches return within a few seconds. Methods are available for searching either a single protein sequence, multiple protein sequence alignment or profile HMM against a target sequence database, and for searching a protein sequence against Pfam. The web server is designed to cater to a range of different user expertise and accepts batch uploading of multiple queries at once. All search methods are also available as RESTful web services, thereby allowing them to be readily integrated as remotely executed tasks in locally scripted workflows. We have focused on minimizing search times and the ability to rapidly display tabular results, regardless of the number of matches found, developing graphical summaries of the search results to provide quick, intuitive appraisement of them.},

abstract = {Improved thermodynamic parameters for prediction of RNA duplex formation are derived from optical melting studies of 90 oligoribonucleotide duplexes containing only Watson-Crick base pairs. To test end or base composition effects, new sets of duplexes are included that have identical nearest neighbors, but different base compositions and therefore different ends. Duplexes with terminal GC pairs are more stable than duplexes with the same nearest neighbors but terminal AU pairs. Penalizing terminal AU base pairs by 0.45 kcal/mol relative to terminal GC base pairs significantly improves predictions of DeltaG degrees37 from a nearest-neighbor model. A physical model is suggested in which the differential treatment of AU and GC ends accounts for the dependence of the total number of Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds on the base composition of a duplex. On average, the new parameters predict DeltaG degrees37, DeltaH degrees, DeltaS degrees, and TM within 3.2\%, 6.0\%, 6.8\%, and 1.3 degreesC, respectively. These predictions are within the limit of the model, based on experimental results for duplexes predicted to have identical thermodynamic parameters.},

abstract = {To better elucidate RNA structure-function relationships and to improve the design of pharmaceutical agents that target specific RNA motifs, an understanding of RNA primary, secondary, and tertiary structure is necessary. The prediction of RNA secondary structure from sequence is an intermediate step in predicting RNA three-dimensional structure. RNA secondary structure is typically predicted using a nearest neighbor model based on free energy parameters. The current free energy parameters for 2 × 3 nucleotide loops are based on a 23-member data set of 2 × 3 loops and internal loops of other sizes. A database of representative RNA secondary structures was searched to identify 2 × 3 nucleotide loops that occur in nature. Seventeen of the most frequent 2 × 3 nucleotide loops in this database were studied by optical melting experiments. Fifteen of these loops melted in a two-state manner, and the associated experimental $\Delta$G°(37,2×3) values are, on average, 0.6 and 0.7 kcal/mol different from the values predicted for these internal loops using the predictive models proposed by Lu, Turner, and Mathews [Lu, Z. J., Turner, D. H., and Mathews, D. H. (2006) Nucleic Acids Res. 34, 4912-4924] and Chen and Turner [Chen, G., and Turner, D. H. (2006) Biochemistry 45, 4025-4043], respectively. These new $\Delta$G°(37,2×3) values can be used to update the current algorithms that predict secondary structure from sequence. To improve free energy calculations for duplexes containing 2 × 3 nucleotide loops that still do not have experimentally determined free energy contributions, an updated predictive model was derived. This new model resulted from a linear regression analysis of the data reported here combined with 31 previously studied 2 × 3 nucleotide internal loops. Most of the values for the parameters in this new predictive model are within experimental error of those of the previous models, suggesting that approximations and assumptions associated with the derivation of the previous nearest neighbor parameters were valid. The updated predictive model predicts free energies of 2 × 3 nucleotide internal loops within 0.4 kcal/mol, on average, of the experimental free energy values. Both the experimental values and the updated predictive model can be used to improve secondary structure prediction from sequence.},

abstract = {A dynamic programming algorithm for prediction of RNA secondary structure has been revised to accommodate folding constraints determined by chemical modification and to include free energy increments for coaxial stacking of helices when they are either adjacent or separated by a single mismatch. Furthermore, free energy parameters are revised to account for recent experimental results for terminal mismatches and hairpin, bulge, internal, and multibranch loops. To demonstrate the applicability of this method, in vivo modification was performed on 5S rRNA in both Escherichia coli and Candida albicans with 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate, dimethyl sulfate, and kethoxal. The percentage of known base pairs in the predicted structure increased from 26.3\% to 86.8\% for the E. coli sequence by using modification constraints. For C. albicans, the accuracy remained 87.5\% both with and without modification data. On average, for these sequences and a set of 14 sequences with known secondary structure and chemical modification data taken from the literature, accuracy improves from 67\% to 76\%. This enhancement primarily reflects improvement for three sequences that are predicted with <40\% accuracy on the basis of energetics alone. For these sequences, inclusion of chemical modification constraints improves the average accuracy from 28\% to 78\%. For the 11 sequences with <6\% pseudoknotted base pairs, structures predicted with constraints from chemical modification contain on average 84\% of known canonical base pairs.},

We have solved the crystal structure of an RNA fragment containing two Homo sapiens cytoplasmic A sites. Each of the two A sites presents a different conformational state. In one state, adenines A1492 and A1493 are fully bulged-out with C1409 forming a wobble-like pair to A1491. In the second state, adenines A1492 and A1493 form non-Watson-Crick pairs with C1409 and G1408, respectively while A1491 bulges out. The first state of the eukaryotic A site is, thus, basically the same as in the bacterial A site with bulging A1492 and A1493. It is the state used for recognition of the codon/anticodon complex. On the contrary, the second state of the H.sapiens cytoplasmic A site is drastically different from any of those observed for the bacterial A site without bulging A1492 and A1493.},

abstract = {The ribosome catalyzes peptidyl transfer reactions at the growing nascent polypeptide chain. Here, we present a structural mechanism for selecting cognate over near-cognate A/T transfer RNA (tRNA). In part, the structural basis for the fidelity of translation relies on accommodation to filter cognate from near-cognate tRNAs. To examine the assembly of tRNAs within the ribonucleic-riboprotein complex, we conducted a series of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the entire solvated 70S E. coli ribosome, along with its associated cofactors, proteins, and messenger RNA (mRNA). We measured the motion of the A/T state of tRNA between initial binding and full accommodation. The mechanism of rejection was investigated. Using novel in-house algorithms, we determined trajectory pathways. Despite the large intersubunit cavity, the available space is limited by the presence of the tRNA, which is equally large. This article describes a "structural gate," formed between helices 71 and 92 on the ribosomal large subunit, that restricts tRNA motion. The gate and the interacting protein, L14, of the 50S ribosome act as steric filters in two consecutive substeps during accommodation, each requiring: (1) sufficient energy contained in the hybrid tRNA kink and (2) sufficient energy in the Watson-Crick base pairing of the codon-anticodon. We show that these barriers act to filter out near-cognate tRNA and promote proofreading of the codon-anticodon. Since proofreading is essential for understanding the fidelity of translation, our model for the dynamics of this process has substantial biomedical implications.

abstract = {The structure of a 34-nucleotide RNA pseudoknot that causes efficient -1 frameshifting in the messenger RNA of mouse mammary tumor virus has been investigated by NMR. Spectral assignment of the pseudoknot was facilitated by comparative NMR studies on the pseudoknot and on two smaller hairpin RNAs, and by using selective 13C labeling and 13C-edited NMR techniques. The three-dimensional structure of the pseudoknot has been determined. The frameshifter pseudoknot possesses structural features not observed in previously reported model pseudoknots. It has a compact structure with a pronounced bend at the junction of its G.C-rich stems. A single adenylate residue is intercalated between the two stems so that direct coaxial staking of the stems is not possible. The lack of an opposing nucleotide for the stacked, intervening adenylate creates a hinge in the pseudoknot. Most of the loop nucleotides are restrained by base staking interactions which keep the loops from adopting extended conformations. The sterically constrained loops direct the bending of the pseudoknot at the stem-stem junction. The roles of the intercalated adenylate and loop lengths in causing bending can explain their requirement for efficient frameshifting. Our NMR data also indicate that there are internal dynamics associated with the pseudoknot. The unique, compact structure and conformational flexibility of the pseudoknot may be required for recognition and favourable interaction with the translating ribosome, or with translation factors associated with the ribosome.},

abstract = {We propose a new method for detecting conserved RNA secondary structures in a family of related RNA sequences. Our method is based on a combination of thermodynamic structure prediction and phylogenetic comparison. In contrast to purely phylogenetic methods, our algorithm can be used for small data sets of approximately 10 sequences, efficiently exploiting the information contained in the sequence variability. The procedure constructs a prediction only for those parts of sequences that are consistent with a single conserved structure. Our implementation produces reasonable consensus structures without user interference. As an example we have analysed the complete HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) genomes as well as the small segment of hantavirus. Our method confirms the known structures in HIV-1 and predicts previously unknown conserved RNA secondary structures in HCV.},

abstract = {The macrolide antibiotic erythromycin interacts with bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) making contacts that are limited to hairpin 35 in domain II of the rRNA and to the peptidyl transferase loop in domain V. These two regions are probably folded close together in the 23S rRNA tertiary structure and form a binding pocket for macrolides and other drug types. Erythromycin has been derivatized by replacing the L-cladinose moiety at position 3 by a keto group (forming the ketolide antibiotics) and by an alkyl-aryl extension at positions 11/12 of the lactone ring. All the drugs footprint identically within the peptidyl transferase loop, giving protection against chemical modification at A2058, A2059 and G2505, and enhancing the accessibility of A2062. However, the ketolide derivatives bind to ribosomes with widely varying affinities compared with erythromycin. This variation correlates with differences in the hairpin 35 footprints. Erythromycin enhances the modification at position A752. Removal of cladinose lowers drug binding 70-fold, with concomitant loss of the A752 footprint. However, the 11/12 extension strengthens binding 10-fold, and position A752 becomes protected. These findings indicate how drug derivatization can improve the inhibition of bacteria that have macrolide resistance conferred by changes in the peptidyl transferase loop.},

Fifteen clinical isolates resistant to tetracycline were found to have cytosine instead of guanine at a position cognate with Escherichia coli 16S rRNA base 1058 in a region important for peptide chain termination and translational accuracy known as helix 34. Cytosine at base 1058 was not detected in the laboratory mutants or the tetracycline-susceptible strains. The apparent mutation was recreated by site-directed mutagenesis in the cloned E. coli ribosomal operon, rrnB, encoded by pKK3535.E. coli strains carrying the mutant plasmid were more resistant to tetracycline than those carrying the wild-type plasmid both in MIC determinations and when grown in tetracycline-containing liquid medium. These data are consistent with a role for the single 16S rRNA base mutation in clinical tetracycline resistance in cutaneous propionibacteria.},

Aminoacyl-tRNA is delivered to the ribosome by elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), which hydrolyzes guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and releases tRNA in response to codon recognition. The signaling pathway that leads to GTP hydrolysis upon codon recognition is critical to accurate decoding. Here we present the crystal structure of the ribosome complexed with EF-Tu and aminoacyl-tRNA, refined to 3.6 angstrom resolution. The structure reveals details of the tRNA distortion that allows aminoacyl-tRNA to interact simultaneously with the decoding center of the 30S subunit and EF-Tu at the factor binding site. A series of conformational changes in EF-Tu and aminoacyl-tRNA suggests a communication pathway between the decoding center and the guanosine triphosphatase center of EF-Tu.},

Fusidic acid traps EF-G in a conformation intermediate between the guanosine triphosphate and guanosine diphosphate forms. The interaction of EF-G with ribosomal elements implicated in stimulating catalysis, such as the L10-L12 stalk and the L11 region, and of domain IV of EF-G with the tRNA at the peptidyl-tRNA binding site (P site) and with mRNA shed light on the role of these elements in EF-G function.

Since finding effective target sites within RNA is a hard work for antisense ODNs design, various experimental methods and computational approaches have been proposed. For better sharing of the experimented and published ODNs, valid and invalid ODNs reported in literatures are screened, collected and stored in AOBase. Till now, approximately 700 ODNs against 46 target mRNAs are contained in AOBase. Entries can be explored via TargetSearch and AOSearch web retrieval interfaces. AOBase can not only be useful in ODNs selection for gene function exploration, but also contribute to mining rules and developing algorithms for rational ODNs design.

Here, we describe the use of an affinity-tagging system for the purification of mutant ribosomes and analysis of four universally conserved nucleotides in the innermost layer of the active site: A2451, U2506, U2585, and A2602. While pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of the peptidyl transferase activity of the mutant ribosomes reveals substantially reduced rates of peptide bond formation using the minimal substrate puromycin, their rates of peptide bond formation are unaffected when the substrates are intact aminoacyl-tRNAs. These mutant ribosomes do, however, display substantial defects in peptide release. These results reveal a view of the catalytic center in which an inner shell of conserved nucleotides is pivotal for peptide release, while an outer shell is responsible for promoting peptide bond formation.},

abstract = {A series of nonionic oligonucleotide analogues, the deoxyribooligonucleoside methylphosphonates, were synthesized. The base sequences of these compounds, d(ApGpGp), d(ApGpGp)(2), and d[(ApGpGp)(2)T], are complementary to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (-A-C-C-U-C-C-U-) found at the 3' end of bacterial 16S rRNA. These nonionic oligonucleotide analogues were tested for their ability to inhibit the in vitro translation of mRNAs in cell-free systems of Escherichia coli and rabbit reticulocyte. In the E. coli system, both d(ApGpGp)(2) and d[(ApGpGp)(2)T] effectively inhibited MS-2 RNA-directed protein synthesis but they had much less effect on either poly(U)- or poly(A)-directed polypeptide synthesis. In the reticulocyte system, these compounds had no significant effect on the translation of globin mRNA. The observation that d[(ApGpGp)(2)[(3)H]T)] binds to 70S ribosomes (association constant, 2.0 x 10(4) M(-1), 37 degrees C) together with the specificity of the inhibitory action of these compounds on protein synthesis strongly suggests that inhibition of translation is a consequence of analogue binding to Shine-Dalgarno sequence of 16S rRNA. The oligonucleoside methylphosphonates inhibited both protein synthesis (without concurrent inhibition of RNA synthesis) and colony formation by E. coli ML 308-225 (a permeable mutant) whose cell wall contains negligible quantities of lipopolysaccharide but had no effect on wild-type E. coli B. Our preliminary results on the uptake of oligodeoxyribonucleoside methylphosphonates by E. coli B show that these cells are not permeable to oligomers longer than 4 nucleotidyl units. Although oligodeoxyribonucleoside methylphosphonates are taken up by mammalian cells in culture, this series of analogues had negligible inhibitory effects on colony formation by transformed human cells. This study indicates that this class of nonionic oligonucleotide analogues can be used to probe and regulate the function and structure of nucleic acids of defined sequence within living cells.},

The ligands were employed as competitors for selected sites on 16S rRNA known to be accessible for hybridization to cDNA oligomers, regions 517-528, 1397-1404, and 1534-1542. The binding of cDNAs 1534-1541 and 1398-1403 decreased in the presence of the ligand pair poly(U)/tRNAPhe. Only the binding of cDNA 1534-1541 was affected by poly(AGU), while none of the complementary DNA oligomer binding was affected by tRNAPhe or tRNAfMet alone. The poly(AGU)/tRNAfMet ligand pair caused an additional decline in the binding of cDNA 1534-1541, relative to that caused by poly(AGU) alone, but the ligand pair did not affect the binding of the cDNA oligomers 517-528 or 1398-1403. The inclusion of the initiation factors did not significantly alter the binding level decreases observed for cDNA 1534-1541 in the presence of mRNAs or tRNA. At the 517-528 and 1398-1403 regions, the inclusion of the initiation factors, in either the presence or absence of the other ligands, caused a large decrease in the binding of the cDNA oligomers. The oligomers complementary to 16S bases 517-528 and 1398-1403 did not bind to tight-couple or reassociated 70S ribosomes. The data are discussed in terms of the decoding site hypothesis, and in terms of the mRNA alignment mechanism proposed by Trifonov [1].},

The plasmid-coded rRNA was processed and assembled into 30S ribosomal subunits in E. coli and caused a retardation of cell growth. The mutation affected crucial functional roles of the 30S subunit in the initiation of protein synthesis. The affinity of the mutant 30S subunits for 50S subunits was reduced and the association equilibrium constant for initiation factor 3 was decreased by a factor of 10 compared to wild-type 30S subunits. The interrelationship among the region of residue 790 in 16S rRNA, subunit association, and initiation factor 3 binding during initiation complex formation, as revealed by this study, offers insights into the functional role of rRNA in protein synthesis.},

abstract = {The small and large subunits of the ribosome are held together by a series of bridges, involving RNA-RNA, RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. Some 12 bridges have been described for the Escherichia coli 70S ribosome. In this work, we have targeted for mutagenesis, some of the 16S rRNA residues involved in the formation of intersubunit bridges B3, B5, B6, B7b and B8. In addition to effects on subunit association, the mutant ribosomes also affect the fidelity of translation; bridges B5, B6 and B8 increase decoding errors during elongation, while disruption of bridges B3 and B7b alters the stringency of start codon selection. Moreover, mutations in the bridge B5, B6 and B8 regions of 16S rRNA also correct the growth and decoding defects associated with alterations in ribosomal protein S12. These results link bridges B5, B6 and B8 with the decoding process and are consistent with the recently described location of translation factor EF-Tu on the ribosome and the proposed involvement of h14 in activating Guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis by aminoacyl-tRNA • EF-Tu • GTP. These observations are consistent with a model in which bridges B5, B6 and B8 contribute to the fidelity of translation by modulating GTP hydrolysis by aminoacyl-tRNA • EF-Tu • GTP ternary complexes during the elongation phase of protein synthesis.},

The 30S and 50S subunits of the ribosome associate through structurally defined intersubunit bridges burying 6,000 A(2), 80\% of which is buried in conserved RNA-RNA interactions. Intersubunit bridges bind translation factors, may coordinate peptide bond formation and translocation and may be actively remodeled in the post-termination complex, but the functional importance of numerous 30S bridge nucleotides had been unknown. We carried out large-scale combinatorial mutagenesis and in vivo selections on 30S nucleotides that form RNA-RNA intersubunit bridges in the Escherichia coli ribosome. We determined the covariation and functional importance of bridge nucleotides, allowing comparison of the structural interface and phylogenetic data to the functional epitope. Our results reveal how information for ribosome function is partitioned across bridges, and suggest a subset of nucleotides that may have measurable effects on individual steps of the translational cycle.},

abstract = {The large and small subunits of the ribosome are joined by a series of bridges that are conserved among mitochondrial, bacterial, and eukaryal ribosomes. In addition to joining the subunits together at the initiation of protein synthesis, a variety of other roles have been proposed for these bridges. These roles include transmission of signals between the functional centers of the two subunits, modulation of tRNA-ribosome and factor-ribosome interactions, and mediation of the relative movement of large and small ribosomal subunits during translocation. The majority of the bridges involve RNA-RNA interactions, and to gain insight into their function, we constructed mutations in the 23 S rRNA regions involved in forming 7 of the 12 intersubunit bridges in the Escherichia coli ribosome. The majority of the mutants were viable in strains expressing mutant rRNA exclusively but had distinct growth phenotypes, particularly at 30 degrees C, and the mutant ribosomes promoted a variety of miscoding errors. Analysis of subunit association activities both in vitro and in vivo indicated that, with the exception of the bridge B5 mutants, at least one mutation at each bridge site affected 70 S ribosome formation. These results confirm the structural data linking bridges with subunit-subunit interactions and, together with the effects on decoding fidelity, indicate that intersubunit bridges function at multiple stages of protein synthesis.},

abstract = {VMD is a molecular graphics program designed for the display and analysis of molecular assemblies, in particular biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids. VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more "representations," in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++, using an object-oriented design; the program, including source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.},

abstract = {Through a mechanism known as RNA interference (RNAi), small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules can target complementary mRNA strands for degradation, thus specifically inhibiting gene expression. The ability of siRNAs to inhibit gene expression offers a mechanism that can be exploited for novel therapeutics. Indeed, over the past decade, at least 21 siRNA therapeutics have been developed for more than a dozen diseases, including various cancers, viruses, and genetic disorders. Like other biological drugs, RNAi-based therapeutics often require a delivery vehicle to transport them to the targeted cells. Thus, the clinical advancement of numerous siRNA drugs has relied on the development of siRNA carriers, including biodegradable nanoparticles, lipids, bacteria, and attenuated viruses. Most therapies permit systemic delivery of the siRNA drug, while others use ex vivo delivery by autologous cell therapy. Advancements in bioengineering and nanotechnology have led to improved control of delivery and release of some siRNA therapeutics. Likewise, progress in molecular biology has allowed for improved design of the siRNA molecules. Here, we provide an overview of siRNA therapeutics in clinical trials, including their clinical progress, the challenges they have encountered, and the future they hold in the treatment of human diseases.},

abstract = {In this study we describe a novel method to investigate the RNA-RNA interactions between a small RNA and its target that we termed 'RNA walk'. The method is based on UV-induced AMT cross-linking in vivo followed by affinity selection of the hybrid molecules and mapping the intermolecular adducts by RT-PCR or real-time PCR. Domains carrying the cross-linked adducts fail to efficiently amplify by PCR compared with non-cross-linked domains. This method was calibrated and used to study the interaction between a special tRNA-like molecule (sRNA-85) that is part of the trypanosome signal recognition particle (SRP) complex and the ribosome. Four contact sites between sRNA-85 and rRNA were identified by 'RNA walk' and were further fine-mapped by primer extension. Two of the contact sites are expected; one contact site mimics the interaction of the mammalian Alu domain of SRP with the ribosome and the other contact sites include a canonical tRNA interaction. The two other cross-linked sites could not be predicted. We propose that 'RNA walk, is a generic method to map target RNA small RNAs interactions in vivo.},

We report here 200-ns-long MD simulations of pure (DMPC and DMPG) and mixed equimolar (DMPC/DMPG, DMPC/DMPS, and DMPC/DMPA) bilayers that each contain 256 lipids. The intra- and intermolecular interaction patterns in pure and mixed bilayers are analyzed and compared. The effect of monovalent ions (Na+) on the formation of salt-bridges is investigated. In particular, the number of Na(+)-mediated clusters in the presence of DMPS is higher than with DMPG and DMPA. We observe a preferential clustering of DMPS (and to some extent DMPA) lipids together rather than with DMPC molecules, which can explain the phase separation observed experimentally for DMPC/DMPS and DMPC/DMPA bilayers.},

abstract = {Neutrophil apoptosis is a highly regulated process essential for inflammation resolution, the molecular mechanisms of which are only partially elucidated. In this study, we describe a survival pathway controlled by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a nuclear factor involved in DNA replication and repairing of proliferating cells. We show that mature neutrophils, despite their inability to proliferate, express high levels of PCNA exclusively in their cytosol and constitutively associated with procaspases, presumably to prevent their activation. Notably, cytosolic PCNA abundance decreased during apoptosis, and increased during in vitro and in vivo exposure to the survival factor granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Peptides derived from the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, which compete with procaspases to bind PCNA, triggered neutrophil apoptosis thus demonstrating that specific modification of PCNA protein interactions affects neutrophil survival. Furthermore, PCNA overexpression rendered neutrophil-differentiated PLB985 myeloid cells significantly more resistant to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand- or gliotoxin-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a decrease in PCNA expression after PCNA small interfering RNA transfection sensitized these cells to apoptosis. Finally, a mutation in the PCNA interdomain-connecting loop, the binding site for many partners, significantly decreased the PCNA-mediated antiapoptotic effect. These results identify PCNA as a regulator of neutrophil lifespan, thereby highlighting a novel target to potentially modulate pathological inflammation.},

(i) Homo logous regions are rapidly identified by the fast Fourier transform (FFT), in which an amino acid sequence is converted to a sequence composed of volume and polarity values of each amino acid residue. (ii) We propose a simplified scoring system that performs well for reducing CPU time and increasing the accuracy of alignments even for sequences having large insertions or extensions as well as distantly related sequences of similar length. Two different heuristics, the progressive method (FFT-NS-2) and the iterative refinement method (FFT-NS-i), are implemented in MAFFT. The performances of FFT-NS-2 and FFT-NS-i were compared with other methods by computer simulations and benchmark tests; the CPU time of FFT-NS-2 is drastically reduced as compared with CLUSTALW with comparable accuracy. FFT-NS-i is over 100 times faster than T-COFFEE, when the number of input sequences exceeds 60, without sacrificing the accuracy.},

However, practical use of profile HMM methods has been hindered by the computational expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an acceleration heuristic for profile HMMs, the "multiple segment Viterbi" (MSV) algorithm. The MSV algorithm computes an optimal sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped vector-parallel approach previously described for fast Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a 20-fold acceleration of the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward algorithms using a method I call "sparse rescaling". These methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full HMM Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is implemented in the freely available HMMER3 software package. Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic MSV filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to unaccelerated profile HMM searches. HMMER3 is substantially more sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than HMMER2. HMMER3 is now about as fast as BLAST for protein searches.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is an important step in comparative sequence analyses. Parallelization is a key technique for reducing the time required for large-scale sequence analyses. The three calculation stages, all-to-all comparison, progressive alignment and iterative refinement, of the MAFFT MSA program were parallelized using the POSIX Threads library. Two natural parallelization strategies (best-first and simple hill-climbing) were implemented for the iterative refinement stage. Based on comparisons of the objective scores and benchmark scores between the two approaches, we selected a simple hill-climbing approach as the default. AVAILABILITY: The parallelized version of MAFFT is available at http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/. This version currently supports the Linux operating system only.},

abstract = {Antibiotics are among the most valuable compounds used for fighting human diseases. Unfortunately, pathogenic bacteria have evolved towards resistance. One important and frequently forgotten aspect of antibiotics and their resistance genes is that they evolved in non-clinical (natural) environments before the use of antibiotics by humans. Given that the biosphere is mainly formed by micro-organisms, learning the functional role of antibiotics and their resistance elements in nature has relevant implications both for human health and from an ecological perspective. Recent works have suggested that some antibiotics may serve for signalling purposes at the low concentrations probably found in natural ecosystems, whereas some antibiotic resistance genes were originally selected in their hosts for metabolic purposes or for signal trafficking. However, the high concentrations of antibiotics released in specific habitats (for instance, clinical settings) as a consequence of human activity can shift those functional roles. The pollution of natural ecosystems by antibiotics and resistance genes might have consequences for the evolution of the microbiosphere. Whereas antibiotics produce transient and usually local challenges in microbial communities, antibiotic resistance genes present in gene-transfer units can spread in nature with consequences for human health and the evolution of environmental microbiota that are largely ignored.},

abstract = {Since the first usage of antimicrobials, the burden of resistance among bacteria has progressively increased and has accelerated within the last 10 years. Antibiotic resistance genes were present at very low levels prior to the introduction of antibiotics and it is largely the selective pressure of antibiotic use and the resulting exposure of bacteria, not only in humans but also in companion and food animals and the environment, which has caused the rise. The increasing mobility across the globe of people, food and animals is another factor. Examples of this are the international pandemic of different genotypes of CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (particularly CTX-M-14 and -15) and the emergence of the carbapenemase KPC-1 in both the USA and Israel. This review details examples of both the emergence and dissemination through different genetic routes, both direct and indirect selective pressure, of significance resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus species, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas/Acinetobacter. The response made by society to reduce resistance involves surveillance, reduced usage, improved infection control and the introduction of new antimicrobial agents. Although efforts are being made in all these areas, there is an urgent need to increase the effectiveness of these interventions or some bacterial infections will become difficult if not impossible to treat reliably.},

abstract = {The environment, and especially freshwater, constitutes a reactor where the evolution and the rise of new resistances occur. In water bodies such as waste water effluents, lakes, and rivers or streams, bacteria from different sources, e.g., urban, industrial, and agricultural waste, probably selected by intensive antibiotic usage, are collected and mixed with environmental species. This may cause two effects on the development of antibiotic resistances: first, the contamination of water by antibiotics or other pollutants lead to the rise of resistances due to selection processes, for instance, of strains over-expressing broad range defensive mechanisms, such as efflux pumps. Second, since environmental species are provided with intrinsic antibiotic resistance mechanisms, the mixture with allochthonous species is likely to cause genetic exchange. In this context, the role of phages and integrons for the spread of resistance mechanisms appears significant. Allochthonous species could acquire new resistances from environmental donors and introduce the newly acquired resistance mechanisms into the clinics. This is illustrated by clinically relevant resistance mechanisms, such as the fluoroquinolones resistance genes qnr. Freshwater appears to play an important role in the emergence and in the spread of antibiotic resistances, highlighting the necessity for strategies of water quality improvement. We assume that further knowledge is needed to better understand the role of the environment as reservoir of antibiotic resistances and to elucidate the link between environmental pollution by anthropogenic pressures and emergence of antibiotic resistances. Only an integrated vision of these two aspects can provide elements to assess the risk of spread of antibiotic resistances via water bodies and suggest, in this context, solutions for this urgent health issue.},

abstract = {Adaptation is normally viewed as the enemy of the antibiotic discovery and development process because adaptation among pathogens to antibiotic exposure leads to resistance. We present a method here that, in contrast, exploits the power of adaptation among antibiotic producers to accelerate the discovery of antibiotics. A competition-based adaptive laboratory evolution scheme is presented whereby an antibiotic-producing microorganism is competed against a target pathogen and serially passed over time until the producer evolves the ability to synthesize a chemical entity that inhibits growth of the pathogen. When multiple Streptomyces clavuligerus replicates were adaptively evolved against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus N315 in this manner, a strain emerged that acquired the ability to constitutively produce holomycin. In contrast, no holomycin could be detected from the unevolved wild-type strain. Moreover, genome re-sequencing revealed that the evolved strain had lost pSCL4, a large 1.8 Mbp plasmid, and acquired several single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes that have been shown to affect secondary metabolite biosynthesis. These results demonstrate that competition-based adaptive laboratory evolution can constitute a platform to create mutants that overproduce known antibiotics and possibly to discover new compounds as well.},

Cd-hit-2d compares two protein datasets and reports similar matches between them; cd-hit-est clusters a DNA/RNA sequence database and cd-hit-est-2d compares two nucleotide datasets. All these programs can handle huge datasets with millions of sequences and can be hundreds of times faster than methods based on the popular sequence comparison and database search tools, such as BLAST.},

Assisted by the mobility of selected ribosomal nucleotides, the symmetrical region provides the structural tools that are required not only for peptide bond formation, but also for fast and smooth successive elongation of nascent proteins. It confines the path along which the A-tRNA 3'-end is rotated into the P-site in concert with the overall tRNA/mRNA sideways movement, thus providing the required stereochemistry for peptide bond formation and substrate-mediated catalysis.

The interspecies differences suggest species-specific functions for these sections, while the intraspecies heterogeneity indicates differences among ribosomes. Comparison of the human gene with a partial sequence from the chimpanzee 28S gene yields divergence rates for the two species: 0.8\% for conserved regions of the gene and 3.7\% for a variable region. The rapid divergence rates of variable regions in the ribosomal gene may permit answers to the question of time of separation of closely related species.},

abstract = {Photolysis of [3H]tetracycline in the presence of Escherichia coli ribosomes results in an approximately 1:1 ratio of labelling ribosomal proteins and RNAs. In this work we characterize crosslinks to both 16S and 23S RNAs. Previously, the main target of photoincorporation of [3H]tetracycline into ribosomal proteins was shown to be S7, which is also part of the one strong binding site of tetracycline on the 30S subunit. The crosslinks on 23S RNA map exclusively to the central loop of domain V (G2505, G2576 and G2608) which is part of the peptidyl transferase region. However, experiments performed with chimeric ribosomal subunits demonstrate that peptidyltransferase activity is not affected by tetracycline crosslinked solely to the 50S subunits. Three different positions are labelled on the 16S RNA, G693, G1300 and G1338. The positions of these crosslinked nucleotides correlate well with footprints on the 16S RNA produced either by tRNA or the protein S7. This suggests that the nucleotides are labelled by tetracycline bound to the strong binding site on the 30S subunit. In addition, our results demonstrate that the well known inhibition of tRNA binding to the A-site is solely due to tetracycline crosslinked to 30S subunits and furthermore suggest that interactions of the antibiotic with 16S RNA might be involved in its mode of action.},

The antibiotic binds in the major groove of the model A-site RNA within a pocket created by an A-A base pair and a single bulged adenine. Specific interactions occur between aminoglycoside chemical groups important for antibiotic activity and conserved nucleotides in the RNA.

abstract = {The ribosome is one of the main antibiotic targets in the cell. Recent years brought important insights into the mode of interaction of antibiotics with the ribosome and mechanisms of antibiotic action. Ribosome crystallography provided a detailed view of the interactions between antibiotics and rRNA. Advances in biochemical techniques let us better understand how the binding of small organic molecules can interfere with functions of an enzyme four orders of magnitude larger than the inhibitor. These and other achievements paved the way for the development of new ribosome-targeting antibiotics, some of which have already entered medical practice. The recent progress, problems and new directions of research of ribosome-targeting antibiotics are discussed in this review.},

The structure of its larger subunit revealed that the ribosome is a ribozyme with RNA at the heart of its enzymatic activity that catalyses peptide bond formation. Numerous initiation, elongation and release factors ensure that protein synthesis occurs progressively and with high specificity. In the past few years, high-resolution structures have provided molecular snapshots of different intermediates in ribosome-mediated translation in atomic detail. Together, these studies have revolutionized our understanding of the mechanism of protein synthesis.},

@article{Viceps1975,
abstract = {The inhibition of cell division and the ultimate loss of viability after removal of streptomycin from growing cultures of streptomycin-dependent bacteria are not the result of "unbalanced growth" or of the breakdown of ribosomes. The streptomycin-dependent strain of Escherichia coli K-12 studied continued to synthesize ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein during streptomycin starvation. There was no evidence of a gross imbalance in the ratio of RNA to protein synthesized or of selective degradation of either protein or RNA. Using the sedimentation of subunits in sucrose as the criterion, normal ribosomes were synthesized even after 18 h of streptomycin deprivation, although the rates of appearance of mature 30S and 50S subunits decreased with time of deprivation. Once formed, these ribosomes appeared stable, as did those synthesized before the onset of starvation. Ribosomes isolated from starved dependent cells were as "functional" as ribosomes from cells grown with streptomycin in their capacity to bind aminoacyl-transfer RNA in response to polyuridylic acid or natural messenger RNA to interconvert between active and inactive transfer RNA binding states, and to synthesize proteins in cell-free systems. The effects are consistent with an impaired rate of synthesis of ribosomal components or assembly of ribosomes resulting in a continually diminishing rate of protein synthesis. The effect on cell division may be the result of a decreased rate of protein synthesis in general and the requirement for a specific protein(s) in particular.},

The antibiotic binds in the major groove of the model A-site RNA within a pocket created by an A-A base pair and a single bulged adenine. Specific interactions occur between aminoglycoside chemical groups important for antibiotic activity and conserved nucleotides in the RNA.

abstract = {Termination of protein synthesis by the ribosome requires two release factor (RF) classes. The class II RF3 is a GTPase that removes class I RFs (RF1 or RF2) from the ribosome after release of the nascent polypeptide. RF3 in the GDP state binds to the ribosomal class I RF complex, followed by an exchange of GDP for GTP and release of the class I RF. As GTP hydrolysis triggers release of RF3 (ref. 4), we trapped RF3 on Escherichia coli ribosomes using a nonhydrolysable GTP analogue. Here we show by cryo-electron microscopy that the complex can adopt two different conformational states. In 'state 1', RF3 is pre-bound to the ribosome, whereas in 'state 2' RF3 contacts the ribosome GTPase centre. The transfer RNA molecule translocates from the peptidyl site in state 1 to the exit site in state 2. This translocation is associated with a large conformational rearrangement of the ribosome. Because state 1 seems able to accommodate simultaneously both RF3 and RF2, whose position is known from previous studies, we can infer the release mechanism of class I RFs.},

To select for specific interactions, an excess of the 30S subunits over tetracycline has been used. Primer extension analysis of the 16S rRNA revealed two sites of the modifications: C936 and C948. Considering available data on tetracycline interactions with the prokaryotic 30S subunits, including the presented data (E.coli), X-ray data (T.thermophilus) and genetic data (Helicobacter pylori, E.coli), a second high affinity tetracycline binding site is proposed within the 3'-major domain of the 16S rRNA, in addition to the A-site related tetracycline binding site.},

abstract = {The ribosome is a highly dynamic machine responsible for protein synthesis within the cell. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography structures of ribosomal particles, alone and in complex with diverse ligands (protein factors, RNAs and small molecules), have revealed the dynamic nature of the ribosome and provided much needed insight into translation and its regulation. In the past years, there has been exponential growth in the deposition of cryo-EM maps into the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) as well as atomic structures into the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Unfortunately, the deposited ribosomal particles usually have distinct orientations with respect to one another, which complicate the comparison of the available structures. To simplify this, we have developed a Database of Aligned Ribosomal Complexes, the DARC site (http://darcsite.genzentrum.lmu.de/darc/), which houses the available cryo-EM maps and atomic coordinates of ribosomal particles from the EMDB and PDB aligned within a common coordinate system. An easy-to-use, searchable interface allows users to access and download >130 cryo-EM maps and >300 atomic models in the format of brix and pdb files, respectively. The aligned coordinate system substantially simplifies direct visualization of conformational changes in the ribosome, such as subunit rotation and head-swiveling, as well as direct comparison of bound ligands, such as antibiotics or translation factors.},

Oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes complementary to bases 2448-2454, 2468-2482, and 2497-2505 of 23 S rRNA were hybridized to 50 S subunits in situ. Probe binding was qualitatively assessed by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Each probe was shown to bind specifically with its intended binding site through digestion of the rRNA within the RNA/DNA hetero-duplexes with RNase H and analysis of the digestion fragments using gel electrophoresis. Competitive binding experiments were conducted between each probe and the antibiotics chloramphenicol and erythromycin. The binding of a probe complementary to bases 2497-2505 was attenuated by 70\% upon the binding of chloramphenicol. A probe complementary to bases 2468-2482 showed an increase in binding of 14\% while binding of a probe complementary to bases 2448-2454 was not affected by chloramphenicol binding. Erythromycin did not affect the binding of any of these probes to 50 S subunits. These results suggest that bases within the 2497-2505 region of 23 S rRNA in E. coli may be involved in a chloramphenicol/rRNA interaction.},

abstract = {DEAD-box RNA-dependent ATPases are ubiquitous enzymes that participate in nearly all processes involving RNA, but their detailed molecular functions remain generally unknown. SrmB, one of the five Escherichia coli DEAD-box proteins, participates in the assembly of the large ribosomal subunit notably by facilitating the incorporation of L13, one of the ribosomal proteins that bind 23S rRNA earliest. Previously, we showed that SrmB is tethered to nascent ribosome through interactions with L4, L24 and the region from domain I of 23S rRNA that binds them. To identify the sites of action of SrmB, we have characterized rRNA mutations that bypass SrmB requirement. Five of them affect the same position from two repeated heptanucleotides in domain II of 23S rRNA, whereas two others affect a complementary hexanucleotide in 5S rRNA. Thus the sites of action of SrmB differ from its tethering site. In the mature ribosome, one of the heptanucleotides participates in a highly compact structure that contacts L13, the '1024 G-ribo wrench'. In addition, we have observed that the assembly defect of $\Delta$srmB cells worsens as rRNA synthesis increases. Based on these results, we propose two non-exclusive scenarios for the role of SrmB in ribosome assembly.},

abstract = {Identification of all the protein components of the large subunit (39 S) of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome has been achieved by carrying out proteolytic digestions of whole 39 S subunits followed by analysis of the resultant peptides by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Peptide sequence information was used to search the human EST data bases and complete coding sequences were assembled. The human mitochondrial 39 S subunit has 48 distinct proteins. Twenty eight of these are homologs of the Escherichia coli 50 S ribosomal proteins L1, L2, L3, L4, L7/L12, L9, L10, L11, L13, L14, L15, L16, L17, L18, L19, L20, L21, L22, L23, L24, L27, L28, L30, L32, L33, L34, L35, and L36. Almost all of these proteins have homologs in Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial ribosomes. No mitochondrial homologs to prokaryotic ribosomal proteins L5, L6, L25, L29, and L31 could be found either in the peptides obtained or by analysis of the available data bases. The remaining 20 proteins present in the 39 S subunits are specific to mitochondrial ribosomes. Proteins in this group have no apparent homologs in bacterial, chloroplast, archaebacterial, or cytosolic ribosomes. All but two of the proteins has a clear homolog in D. melanogaster while all can be found in the genome of C. elegans. Ten of the 20 mitochondrial specific 39 S proteins have homologs in S. cerevisiae. Homologs of 2 of these new classes of ribosomal proteins could be identified in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome.},

abstract = {We have tested a model for global ribosome biosynthesis by examining the effects of increased gene dosage on the synthesis of rRNA. Increasing gene dosage does not lead to a significant increase in total rRNA transcription; i.e., rRNA synthesis from individual rRNA operons is reduced to keep total rRNA production unchanged. In contrast, when the plasmid-encoded rRNA operons used to increase gene dosage contain deletions within the rRNA coding region, rRNA transcription is gene-dosage-dependent; i.e., rRNA regulation is relieved. We find that the syntheses of most, if not all, tRNAs are also subject to the same controls as rRNA transcription. We conclude that the production of functional rRNA is monitored by the regulatory system that controls rRNA and tRNA transcription. We propose that rRNA and tRNA are negatively controlled by products of rRNA operons and discuss evidence suggesting that ribosomes are the key element involved in the postulated feedback regulation.},

abstract = {The effects of erythromycin on the formation of ribosomal subunits were examined in wild-type Escherichia coli cells and in an RNase E mutant strain. Pulse-chase labelling kinetics revealed a reduced rate of 50S subunit formation in both strains compared with 30S synthesis, which was unaffected by the antibiotic. Growth of cells in the presence of [14C]-erythromycin showed drug binding to 50S particles and to a 50S subunit precursor sedimenting at about 30S in sucrose gradients. Antibiotic binding to the precursor correlated with the decline in 50S formation in both strains. Erythromycin binding to the precursor showed the same 1:1 stoichiometry as binding to the 50S particle. Gel electrophoresis of rRNA from antibiotic-treated organisms revealed the presence of both 23S and 5S rRNAs in the 30S region of sucrose gradients. Hybridization with a 23S rRNA-specific probe confirmed the presence of this species of rRNA in the precursor. Eighteen 50S ribosomal proteins were associated with the precursor particle. A model is presented to account for erythromycin inhibition of 50S formation.},

abstract = {Differences between the structures of bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic ribosomes account for the selective action of antibiotics. Even minor variations in the structure of ribosomes of different bacterial species may lead to idiosyncratic, species-specific interactions of the drugs with their targets. Although crystallographic structures of antibiotics bound to the peptidyl transferase center or the exit tunnel of archaeal (Haloarcula marismortui) and bacterial (Deinococcus radiodurans) large ribosomal subunits have been reported, it remains unclear whether the interactions of antibiotics with these ribosomes accurately reflect those with the ribosomes of pathogenic bacteria. Here we report X-ray crystal structures of the Escherichia coli ribosome in complexes with clinically important antibiotics of four major classes, including the macrolide erythromycin, the ketolide telithromycin, the lincosamide clindamycin, and a phenicol, chloramphenicol, at resolutions of ∼3.3 Å-3.4 Å. Binding modes of three of these antibiotics show important variations compared to the previously determined structures. Biochemical and structural evidence also indicates that interactions of telithromycin with the E. coli ribosome more closely resembles drug binding to ribosomes of bacterial pathogens. The present data further argue that the identity of nucleotides 752, 2609, and 2055 of 23S ribosomal RNA explain in part the spectrum and selectivity of antibiotic action.},

@article{Woodcock1991,
abstract = {We have studied the interactions of the antibiotics apramycin, kasugamycin, myomycin, neamine and pactamycin with 16S rRNA by chemical probing of drug-ribosome complexes. Kasugamycin and pactamycin, which are believed to affect translational initiation, protect bases in common with P-site-bound tRNA. While kasugamycin protects A794 and G926, and causes enhanced reactivity of C795, pactamycin protects G693 and C795. All four of these bases were previously shown to be protected by P-site tRNA or by edeine, another P-site inhibitor. Apramycin and neamine, which both induce miscoding and inhibit translocation, protect A1408, G1419 and G1494, as was also found earlier for neomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin and paromomycin. A1408 and G1494 were previously shown to be protected by A-site tRNA. Surprisingly, myomycin fails to give strong protection of any bases in 16S rRNA, in spite of having an apparently identical target site and mode of action to streptomycin, which protects several bases in the 915 region. Instead, myomycin gives only weak protection of A1408. These results suggest that the binding site(s) of streptomycin and myomycin have yet to be identified.},

abstract = {A comprehensive range of chemical reagents and ribonucleases was employed to investigate the interaction of the antibiotics thiostrepton and micrococcin with the ribosomal protein L11-23S RNA complex and with the 50S subunit. Both antibiotics block processes associated with the ribosomal A-site but differ in their effects on GTP hydrolysis, which is inhibited by thiostrepton and stimulated by micrococcin. The interaction sites of both drugs were shown to occur within the nucleotide sequences A1067-A1098 within the protein L11 binding site on 23S RNA. This region of the ribosome structure is involved in elongation factor-G-dependent GTP hydrolysis and in the stringent response. No effects of drug binding were detected elsewhere in the 23S RNA. In general, the two drugs afforded 23S RNA similar protection from the chemical and nuclease probes in accord with their similar modes of action. One important exception, however, occurred at nucleotide A1067 within a terminal loop where thiostrepton protected the N-1 position while micrococcin rendered it more reactive. This difference correlates with the opposite effects of the two antibiotics on GTPase activity.},

abstract = {The aminoglycosides, a group of structurally related antibiotics, bind to rRNA in the small subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome. Most aminoglycosides are inactive or weakly active against eukaryotic ribosomes. A major difference in the binding site for these antibiotics between prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes is the identity of the nucleotide at position 1408 (Escherichia coli numbering), which is an adenosine in prokaryotic ribosomes and a guanosine in eukaryotic ribosomes. Expression in E.coli of plasmid-encoded 16S rRNA containing an A1408 to G substitution confers resistance to a subclass of the aminoglycoside antibiotics that contain a 6' amino group on ring I. Chemical footprinting experiments indicate that resistance arises from the lower affinity of the drug for the eukaryotic rRNA sequence. The 1408G ribosomes are resistant to the same subclass of aminoglycosides as previously observed both for eukaryotic ribosomes and bacterial ribosomes containing a methylation at the N1 position of A1408. The results indicate that the identity of the nucleotide at position 1408 is a major determinant of specificity of aminoglycoside action, and agree with prior structural studies of aminoglycoside-rRNA complexes.},

@article{McCoy2011,
abstract = {The key role of the bacterial ribosome makes it an important target for antibacterial agents. Indeed, a large number of clinically useful antibiotics target this complex translational ribonucleoprotein machinery. The majority of these compounds, mostly of natural origin, bind to one of the three key ribosomal sites: the decoding (or A-site) on the 30S, the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) on the 50S, and the peptide exit tunnel on the 50S. Antibiotics that bind the A-site, such as the aminoglycosides, interfere with codon recognition and translocation. Peptide bond formation is inhibited when small molecules like oxazolidinones bind at the PTC. Finally, macrolides tend to block the growth of the amino acid chain at the peptide exit tunnel. In this article, the major classes of antibiotics that target the bacterial ribosome are discussed and classified according to their respective target. Notably, most antibiotics solely interact with the RNA components of the bacterial ribosome. The surge seen in the appearance of resistant bacteria has not been met by a parallel development of effective and broad-spectrum new antibiotics, as evident by the introduction of only two novel classes of antibiotics, the oxazolidinones and lipopeptides, in the past decades. Nevertheless, this significant health threat has revitalized the search for new antibacterial agents and novel targets. High resolution structural data of many ribosome-bound antibiotics provide unprecedented insight into their molecular contacts and mode of action and inspire the design and synthesis of new candidate drugs that target this fascinating molecular machine.},

abstract = {Antibiotics target ribosomes at distinct locations within functionally relevant sites. They exert their inhibitory action by diverse modes, including competing with substrate binding, interfering with ribosomal dynamics, minimizing ribosomal mobility, facilitating miscoding, hampering the progression of the mRNA chain, and blocking the nascent protein exit tunnel. Although the ribosomes are highly conserved organelles, they possess subtle sequence and/or conformational variations. These enable drug selectivity, thus facilitating clinical usage. The structural implications of these differences were deciphered by comparisons of high-resolution structures of complexes of antibiotics with ribosomal particles from eubacteria resembling pathogens and from an archaeon that shares properties with eukaryotes. The various antibiotic-binding modes detected in these structures demonstrate that members of antibiotic families possessing common chemical elements with minute differences might bind to ribosomal pockets in significantly different modes, governed by their chemical properties. Similarly, the nature of seemingly identical mechanisms of drug resistance is dominated, directly or via cellular effects, by the antibiotics' chemical properties. The observed variability in antibiotic binding and inhibitory modes justifies expectations for structurally based improved properties of existing compounds as well as for the discovery of novel drug classes.},
